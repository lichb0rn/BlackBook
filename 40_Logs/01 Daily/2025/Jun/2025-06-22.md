# Notes
- Идея - поместить все идеи в одну заметку
>[!quote] [[Your Time, Your Way]]
 A quick tip here is to keep these ideas in a single note. Your brain has an amazing ability to connect ideas together. Something you collected last July may become relevant again when you see an idea you collected in February. Your brain makes a connection and suddenly a good idea has become a great idea. When you go through your ideas, you will easily see any connections. If you keep all your ideas in separate notes, it will be much harder to make those connections.

With this kind of note, I would also suggest you create a recurring task in your task manager, reminding you to review it periodically. Just for reference, I review my ideas note every three months at the end of the quarter.
