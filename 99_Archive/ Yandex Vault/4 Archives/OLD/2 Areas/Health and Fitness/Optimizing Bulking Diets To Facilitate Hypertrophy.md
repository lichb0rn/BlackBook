# [[Optimizing Bulking Diets To Facilitate Hypertrophy]]

For many people with aesthetic goals, attainment of their dream physique will involve adding some amount of muscle mass, and there are noteworthy health benefits associated with increased strength and muscularity, particularly as we age. For this reason, it’s very common for people to take a cyclical approach to dieting, with “bulking” phases consisting of an energy surplus with a focus on muscle gain, and “cutting” phases consisting of an energy deficit with a focus on fat loss.

## Establishing an Energy Surplus to Facilitate Hypertrophy
It’s widely accepted that muscle hypertrophy is maximized in a state of positive energy balance. Despite the widespread acceptance of this idea, several questions persist. For example, **why is an energy surplus advantageous**? **Is an energy surplus absolutely necessary** for muscle growth in all circumstances? Exactly **how large should an energy surplus be** when hypertrophy optimization is the top priority?

#### Why is an energy surplus advantageous?
We can broadly categorize metabolic pathways as **catabolic** or **anabolic**. In **catabolic** pathways, energy-yielding nutrients (e.g., carbs, fats, proteins, and ketones) are broken down to yield energy-poor end products (e.g., carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia), and chemical energy (adenosine triphosphate, or ATP) is released in the process.

**Anabolic** pathways **are the inverse of catabolic** pathways. Rather than breaking down complex molecules into simpler end-products to extract energy, anabolic pathways involve building complex molecules (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and nucleic acids) from simpler precursors (e.g. amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, and nitrogenous bases), and chemical energy is actually required (used) to fuel the synthesis of these more complex end products.

**When demand** for chemical energy **exceeds** the current supply, **catabolic pathways are favored** to liberate ATP. Intuitively, the body tends to scale down any unnecessary and energy-intensive anabolic pathways when catabolic pathways are being ramped up to solve an acute energy shortfall. Thus, at the surface level, we can see how ***maintaining a sufficient supply of accessible energy is an important factor dictating our capacity for muscle hypertrophy***.

#### Is an energy surplus absolutely necessary for muscle growth?
It’s important to recognize that “maintaining a sufficient supply of energy” goes beyond what you ate within the last few hours or maintaining positive energy balance over a given 24-hour period. We store enormous amounts of energy in adipose tissue; for example, we can access over 100,000 kcals of energy by breaking down 11kg of fat.  As such, the concept of maintaining a sufficient supply of energy is intrinsically linked to a combination of long-term energy status (adiposity) and short-term energy status (the day-to-day relationship between energy consumption and energy expenditure).

There is enough published research to render the following statement indisputable: it is possible to gain muscle mass without an energy surplus. In fact, **it’s possible to gain muscle mass in a calorie deficit**.

It appears that adiposity is a major factor impacting the likelihood and magnitude of muscle gain in an energy deficit, which is also known as body recomposition. When long-term energy stores are high (e.g., **we have plenty of stored body fat**), **it’s not** particularly **uncommon** **to observe noteworthy hypertrophy** in the context of neutral, or even negative, energy balance. Conversely, **recomposition is observed more rarely** and in smaller magnitudes **among individuals with very low body-fat levels**. Another critical factor is the size of the energy deficit. 

Recomposition is routinely observed in the context of small energy deficits. However, **as the energy deficit grows, the magnitude of hypertrophy increasingly tends to get blunted.**
A recent meta-regression demonstrated that **recomposition was quite common for calorie deficits up to around 200-300 kcal/day, but pretty atypical for calorie deficits larger than 500 kcal/day**.

So, back to the original question: is an energy surplus absolutely necessary for muscle growth? Empirically, no. **Hypertrophy is frequently observed in the presence of small-to-moderate energy deficits** ([3](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/fulltext/2020/10000/body_recomposition__can_trained_individuals_build.3.aspx)), and this is [particularly true](https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/2149233951/posts/2153928912) for people who have **higher adiposity, less training experience, and a larger gap between their current level of muscularity and their maximal**, genetically-determined limit for muscularity. However, there’s a more pertinent question for hypertrophy: is there a high likelihood of _maximizing_ hypertrophy without an energy surplus?

#### Guidelines for calorie intake and rate of weight gain
If the only goal is maximizing hypertrophy at all costs, then larger is generally better, but real-world scenarios typically aren’t that simple. If we overshoot the caloric surplus necessary to maximize hypertrophy, we invite completely unnecessary fat gain, which might be viewed as unfavorable (depending on the context).

ATP is used in the process of synthesizing new muscle proteins, so we need extra calories to support that energy cost. In addition, resistance training itself costs energy, and energy expenditure tends to remain transiently elevated for hours following an exercise bout. In addition, we need to supply the raw materials (amino acids) for new muscle proteins through dietary intake of protein, and these amino acids contain roughly 4kcal/gram, on average. As calorie intake increases, many individuals experience an [adaptive increase](https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/2149233951/posts/2153928854) in energy expenditure ([6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9880251/)), which further increases their energy needs. This is analogous to [metabolic adaptation](https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/647954/posts/2104285); while underfeeding causes adaptive reductions in energy expenditure, overfeeding has a tendency to cause adaptive increases in energy expenditure. Finally, as you start accruing substantial amounts of muscle mass, total daily energy expenditure will increase further, as muscle mass is a metabolically active tissue that burns around 13 kcal/kg/day at rest ([7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11224660/)), and even more so during exercise and non-exercise physical activity.

Slater and colleagues recommend aiming for a calorie surplus of around 1500-2000 kj/day (**359-478 kcal/day**), which they classify as a “**conservative**” starting point. However, they acknowledge that this estimate is a very rough approximation, and that we don’t currently have the evidence required to establish a precise target or range. They further recommend to “**closely monitor response to the intervention, using changes in body composition and functional capacity to further personalize dietary interventions.**”

#### Three strategies for bulking phase
#### Assume
The “assume” approach is simple and straightforward: it assumes that one’s daily calorie target can be effectively dictated by their goal and current body weight. This strategy assumes that most people will generally maintain their current body weight if they consume roughly 15 kcals per pound of body mass. As a result, a general target for a moderate bulk would be around 17kcal/lb, and a general target for an aggressive bulk would be around 19 kcal/lb (Table 1). These bulking targets tend to work out relatively well for people with lower body weights (especially below 150lb or so), but start to get excessively aggressive (in my opinion) once body weight starts climbing into the 200s and beyond. It’s also important to recognize that total daily energy expenditure can [vary considerably](https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/2148831318/posts/2152314852) from person to person, even if they weigh exactly the same. For these reasons, I do not recommend using the “assume” approach.

#### Estimate
The “estimate” approach involves using validated equations to estimate one’s resting metabolic rate, then using activity factors to further estimate one’s total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). For a step-by-step guide through that estimation process, be sure to check out [this article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/diet/). In short, I recommend using the Cunningham 1980 equation to estimate resting metabolic rate based on fat-free mass (22 × fat-free mass [kg] + 500), and I recommend using the MacroFactor activity correction factors, which range from 1.2-1.6 for general (non-exercise) activity levels, and from 0-0.3 for the additive impact of structured exercise activity. Once TDEE is estimated, you’d aim to eat a certain percentage of that value in accordance with your goal. For example, someone with a maintenance goal would set a calorie target equal to 100% of TDEE, someone on a moderate bulk would aim for 105-110% of TDEE, and someone on an aggressive bulk would aim for 115-120% of TDEE (Table 2).

#### Observe
The “observe” approach involves tracking your body weight every day (ideally measured immediately upon waking), while simultaneously tracking your daily caloric intake. After a couple weeks or so, you should be able to make very informative inferences about your energy needs. For example, if you’re consistently eating around 2400kcal/day and your bodyweight is very stable, then your maintenance calorie intake (and, by extension, TDEE) is around 2400kcal/day. If you’re slowly losing weight while consuming 2400kcal/day, then that intake is putting you in a small caloric deficit; if you’re rapidly gaining weight, then 2400kcal/day is putting you in a large caloric surplus.
