# [[Burnout]]

World Health Organization defines it in its International Classification of Diseases, burnout is the direct result of “chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.

Research has found that when we experience chronic stress for too long, our body “responds by eventually downshifting cortisol production to abnormally low levels.” Researchers describe that it’s as though "our body’s stress response system itself has been burned out".

Usually, our **cortisol levels are highest when we wake up in the morning**. This is, in part, what mobilizes us to get out of bed. This can also be why we have a tougher time getting out of bed when we’re going through an especially stressful period. Our body has down-regulated how much cortisol it produces.

Studies suggest that those **diagnosed with burnout have far lower cortisol levels in the morning** compared with subjects who are not burnt out.

One study found that 59 percent of those diagnosed as burnt out were also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder—possibly because of chronic stress, given research shows that anxiety can be considered a “condition which acts as a protective factor against threatening situations.” Another condition that overlaps with burnout is depression.

Meta-analysis pored over around one thousand studies on burnout and found that it is a significant predictor of too many health factors to mention in one sentence, including “hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hospitalization due to cardiovascular disorder, musculoskeletal pain, changes in pain experiences, prolonged fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory problems, severe injuries and mortality below the age of 45 years.

## Self-checking

Consider scheduling a recurring event in your calendar to check up on how well you’re doing on each of the burnout factors. Use any time you feel negative, exhausted, or unproductive as a cue to check up sooner. You may even want to track these variables over time so you can make sure your trend lines are headed in the right direction.

As author Seth Godin has written, **“If you are using outcomes that are outside of your [[Dichotomy of Control|control]] as fuel for your work, it’s inevitable that you will burn out**. Because it’s not fuel you can replenish, and it’s not fuel that burns without a residue.”
