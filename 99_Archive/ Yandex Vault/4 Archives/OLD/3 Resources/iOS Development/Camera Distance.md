# [[Camera Distance]]

For UI elements in an average app you can consult the following reference for some guidelines on an appropriate camera distance:
- 0.1...500: Very close, lots of perspective distortion.
- 750...2,000: Nice perspective, content is clearly visible.
- 2,000 and up: Almost no perspective distortion.
