# [[Occam’s Razor]]

**Simpler explanations are more likely to be true than complicated ones.** This is the essence of Occam’s Razor, a classic principle of logic and problem solving.

Named after the medieval logician [[William of Ockham,]] Occam’s Razor is a general rule by which we select among competing explanations. Ockham wrote that “a plurality is not to be posited without necessity”—essentially that **we should prefer the simplest explanation with the fewest moving parts**.

If all else is equal, that is if two competing models both have equal explanatory power, it’s more likely that the simple solution suffices.

The simpler explanation for a miracle is that **there are principles of nature being exploited that we do not understand**. This is Hume’s and Sagan’s point.

As scientist and writer [[Carl Sagan]] explains in [[The Demon Haunted World]]:

>   A multitude of aspects of the natural world that were considered miraculous only a few generations ago are now thoroughly understood in terms of physics and chemistry. At least some of the mysteries of today will be comprehensively solved by our descendants. **The fact that we cannot now produce a detailed understanding** of, say, altered states of consciousness in terms of brain chemistry **no more implies the existence of a ‘spirit world’ than a sunflower following the Sun** in its course across the sky was evidence of a literal miracle before we knew about phototropism and plant hormones.

## Dark Matter
In the mid-1970s astronomer [[Vera Rubin]] had a very interesting problem. She had a bunch of data about the behavior of galaxies piling up that wasn’t explained by contemporary theories.

Rubin had been observing the behavior of the Andromeda Galaxy, and had noticed something very strange. As explained in an article on Astronomy.com, “the vast spiral seemed to be rotating all wrong. The stuff at the edges was moving just as fast as the stuff near the center, apparently violating Newton’s Laws of Motion (which also govern how the planets move around our Sun).” This didn’t make any sense. Gravity should exert less pull on distant objects, which should move slower. But Rubin was observing something entirely different.

One possible explanation was something that had been theorized as far back as 1933, by Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who coined the phrase “[[Dark Matter|dark matter]]” to describe a mass we couldn’t see, but which was influencing the behavior of the orbits in the galaxies. Dark matter became the simplest explanation for the observed phenomenon, and [[Vera Rubin]] has been credited with providing the first evidence of its existence.

## Why are more complicated explanations less likely to be true?

 Let’s work it out mathematically. Take two competing explanations, each of which seem to equally explain a given phenomenon. If one of them requires the interaction of three variables and the other the interaction of thirty variables, all of which must have occurred to arrive at the stated conclusion, which of these is more likely to be in error? If each variable has a 99% chance of being correct, the first explanation is only 3% likely to be wrong. The second, more complex explanation, is about nine times as likely to be wrong, or 26%. The simpler explanation is more robust in the face of uncertainty.

## Simplicity can increase efficiency

With limited time and resources, it is not possible to track down every theory with a plausible explanation of a complex, uncertain event.

Here are two short examples of those who got waylaid chasing down complicated solutions when simple ones were most effective.  

 The ten-acre Ivanhoe Reservoir in Los Angeles provides drinking water for over 600,000 people. Its nearly 60 million gallons of water are disinfected with chlorine, as is common practice.12 Ground water often contains elevated levels of a chemical called bromide. When chlorine and bromide mix, then are exposed to sunlight, they create a dangerous carcinogen called bromate. In order to avoid poisoning the water supply, the L.A. Department of Water and Power (DWP) needed a way to shade the water’s surface.

A DWP biologist suggested using “bird balls,” the floating balls that airports use to keep birds from congregating near runways. They require no construction, no parts, no labor, no maintenance, and cost US$0.40 each.
