# [[Thermodynamics]]

Thermodynamics refers to a set of laws of [[Physics]] that provide the ultimate foundation in how the world really works. It helps us understand randomness and disorder in systems and explains the conversion of energy from one form to another, the direction in which heat will flow, and the availability of energy to do work.

All work requires energy, and all systems are headed toward equilibrium.

1. The first law of thermodynamics states that **energy cannot be created or destroyed**; it can only be transferred or changed from one form to another.

There are two forms of energy exchange—heat and work. Heat is energy exchange through thermal interaction and work is energy exchange by any process other than heat. Whereas work can be completely converted into heat, heat cannot be completely converted to work.

2. The second law of thermodynamics states that **entropy** (a measure of disorder simply understood as energy unable to be used to do work) **of an isolated system always increases**.

Isolated systems are those that spontaneously progress toward the state of maximum entropy of the system, also described as thermal equilibrium—no net heat flow between objects. The entropy of the universe only increases with time. One of the impacts of this law is that we need to expend energy to create order. Without the deployment of energy, all things move away from order.

3. The third law of thermodynamics states that **as temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a given system approaches a constant value**.

4. The fourth law of thermodynamics is known as the zeroth law. This is because it was formulated after the first three laws but is fundamental to and assumed by the others. It states that **if two objects are in thermal equilibrium with a third object, then those two objects are also in thermal equilibrium with each other**.


## Putting up walls  

Much of thermodynamics is about equilibrium, including the fact that two systems of different temperatures, when exposed to each other, eventually become the same temperature. What if we consider the equilibrium of two systems not between two containers of different temperature water, but two societies with different values.

If we want to encourage equilibrium, then we can think of sharing as transfer of energy.

Mixing cultures gives them common ground. We move toward social equilibrium when we share ideas and values that have the same foundations.
