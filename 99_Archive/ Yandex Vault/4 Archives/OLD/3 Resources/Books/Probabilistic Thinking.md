# [[Probabilistic Thinking]]

**Probabilistic thinking is essentially trying to estimate, using some tools of math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass.** It is one of the best tools we have to improve the accuracy of our decisions. In a world where each moment is determined by an infinitely complex set of factors, probabilistic thinking helps us identify the most likely outcomes.

Our lack of perfect information about the world gives rise to all of probability theory, and its usefulness. We know now that the future is inherently unpredictable because not all variables can be known and even the smallest error imaginable in our data very quickly throws off our predictions. The best we can do is estimate the future by generating realistic, useful probabilities.

There are three important aspects of probability that we need to explain so you can integrate them into your thinking to get into the ballpark and improve your chances of catching the ball:
1. Bayesian thinking 
2. Fat-tailed curves
3. Asymmetries

[[Thomas Bayes]] and Bayesian thinking: Bayes was an English minister in the first half of the 18th century, whose most famous work, “[[An Essay Toward Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]”, was brought to the attention of the Royal Society by his friend [[Richard Price]] in 1763—two years after his death. The essay concerned how we should adjust probabilities when we encounter new data, and provided the seeds for the great mathematician [[Pierre Simon Laplace]] to develop what we now call [[Формула Байеса|Bayes’s Theorem]].

The core of Bayesian thinking (or Bayesian updating, as it can be called) is this: **given that we have limited but useful information about the world, and are constantly encountering new information, we should probably take into account what we already know when we learn something new**.

Now we need to look at **fat-tailed curves**: Many of us are familiar with the bell curve, that nice, symmetrical wave that captures the relative frequency of so many things from height to exam scores. The bell curve is great because it’s easy to understand and easy to use. Its technical name is normal distribution.

Fat-tailed curves are different. Take a look.
At first glance they seem similar enough. Common outcomes cluster together, creating a wave. The difference is in the tails. In a bell curve the extremes are predictable. There can only be so much deviation from the mean. In a fat-tailed curve there is no real cap on extreme events.

**Asymmetries**: Finally, you need to think about something we might call “metaprobability”—the probability that your probability estimates themselves are any good.

A common asymmetry is people’s ability to estimate the effect of traffic on travel time. How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% early? Almost never? How often do you leave “on time” and arrive 20% late? All the time? Exactly. Your estimation errors are asymmetric, skewing in a single direction. This is often the case with probabilistic decision-making.  

**Far more probability estimates are wrong on the “over-optimistic” side than the “under-optimistic” side.**
