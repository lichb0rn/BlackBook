# [[Antifragile Things That Gain from Disorder]]

We can think about three categories of objects: Ones that are harmed by volatility and unpredictability, ones that are neutral to volatility and unpredictability, and finally, ones that benefit from it. The latter category is anti-fragile — like a package that wants to be mishandled. Up to a point, certain things benefit from volatility, and that’s how we want to be.

There are two ways to handle such a world: **try to predict,** or **try to prepare**. 
Prediction is tempting.

The problem is that nearly **all studies of “expert” predictions in such complex real-world realms** as the stock market, geopolitics, and global finance **have proven** again and again that, for the rare and impactful events in our world, **predicting is impossible**! **It’s more efficient to prepare.**

What are some ways we can prepare?
The first one is what Wall Street traders would call “**upside optionality**”, that is, **seeking out situations that we expect have good odds of offering us opportunities**. Take the example of attending a cocktail party where a lot of people you might like to know are in attendance.
By going to the party, you improve your odds of encountering opportunity.

The second thing we can do is **to learn how to fail properly**. Failing properly has two major components. First, never take a risk that will do you in completely. (Never get taken out of the game completely.) Second, develop the personal resilience to learn from your failures and start again. With these two rules, you can only fail temporarily.

The Antifragile mindset is a unique one. Whenever possible, try to create scenarios where randomness and uncertainty are your friends, not your enemies.
