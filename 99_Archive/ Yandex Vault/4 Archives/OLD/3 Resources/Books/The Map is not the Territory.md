# [[The Map is not the Territory]]

The map of reality is not reality. Even the best maps are imperfect. That’s because they are reductions of what they represent. If a map were to represent the territory with perfect fidelity, it would no longer be a reduction and thus would no longer be useful to us.

1.  A map may have a structure similar or dissimilar to the structure of the territory. The London underground map is super useful to travelers.

2. Two similar structures have similar “logical” characteristics. If a correct map shows Dresden as between Paris and Warsaw, a similar relation is found in the actual territory.

3. A map is not the actual territory. The London underground map does not convey what it’s like to be standing in Covent Garden station.

4. An ideal map would contain the map of the map, the map of the map of the map, etc., endlessly. We may call this characteristic self-reflexiveness.

The truth is, the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction. We need maps and models as guides. But frequently, we don’t remember that our maps and models are abstractions and thus we fail to understand their limits. We forget there is a territory that exists separately from the map. This territory contains details the map doesn’t describe. We run into problems when our knowledge becomes of the map, rather than the actual underlying territory it describes.

When we mistake the map for reality, we start to think we have all the answers. We create static rules or policies that deal with the map but forget that we exist in a constantly changing world.

In order to use a map or model as accurately as possible, we should take three important considerations into account:

-   Reality is the ultimate update.
-   Consider the cartographer.
-   Maps can influence territories.

**Reality is the ultimate update**: territories change, sometimes faster than the maps and models that describe them. We can and should update them based on our own experiences in the territory. That’s how good maps are built: feedback loops created by explorers.

**Consider the cartographer**: Maps are not purely objective creations. They reflect the values, standards, and limitations of their creators. For example, historians have shown that the modern borders of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq reflect British and French determination to maintain influence in the Middle East after World War I.10 Thus, they are a better map of Western interest than of local custom and organization. Models, then, are most useful when we consider them in the context they were created. What was the cartographer trying to achieve? How does this influence what is depicted in the map?

**Maps can influence territories**: This problem was part of the central argument put forth by Jane Jacobs in her groundbreaking work, The Death and Life of Great American Cities. She chronicled the efforts of city planners who came up with elaborate models for the design and organization of cities without paying any attention to how cities actually work. They then tried to fit the cities into the model. She describes how cities were changed to correspond to these models, and the often negative consequences of these efforts.
