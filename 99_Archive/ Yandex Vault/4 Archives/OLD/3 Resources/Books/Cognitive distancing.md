# [[Cognitive distancing]]

“Distancing” refers to the ability to view one’s own thoughts (or beliefs) as constructions of “reality” rather than as reality itself.

Later generations of clinicians and researchers discovered that rigorous training in cognitive distancing, by itself, was sufficient in many cases to bring about therapeutic improvement. Greater emphasis on this cognitive skill is an integral part what became known as the mindfulness and acceptance approach to [[Когнитивно-поведенческая терапия|cognitive behavioral therapy]].

There are several distancing methods found in the ancient [[Stoicism|Stoic]] literature. For instance, you can help yourself gain cognitive distance just by speaking to (“apostrophizing”) your thoughts and feelings, saying something like, “You are just a feeling and not really the thing you claim to represent,” as [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] in the [[Handbook]] advised his students to do.
