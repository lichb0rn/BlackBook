# [[Loss Aversion]]

Loss aversion is one of the principles that govern the value of outcomes. [[Daniel Kahneman]] explains it like this: “**When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains**.” According to Kahneman, people are willing to risk losing $100 for every $250 of potential gains. The loss aversion coefficient is 1:2.5.2 

This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce. 

When it comes to [[Reciprocity|reciprocity]], we need to understand, “**We are driven more strongly to avoid losses than to achieve gains**.” This is why putting ourselves out there, engaging people who might dismiss or reject us, is so scary. Because in the one-off situation, the pain it will cause is perceived as stronger than the positive feelings of acceptance. **The trick is to start looking at outcomes in the aggregate instead of focusing on each unique situation.**
