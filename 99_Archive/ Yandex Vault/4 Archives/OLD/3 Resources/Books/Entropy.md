# [[Entropy]]

[[Murray Gell-Mann]], a Nobel prize winning physicist, clarifies entropy in contexts such as organizing a pile of coins or the mixing of jelly and peanut butter in their containers:

«The explanation is that **there are more ways for coins to be mixed up than sorted**. There are more ways for peanut butter and jelly to contaminate each other’s containers than to remain completely pure. To the extent that chance is operating, **it is likely that a closed system that has some order will move toward disorder**, which offers so many more possibilities.»

## Entropy and society
  
Humans put a lot of effort into preventing disorder. If we look at society broadly, we notice that disorder flares up all the time.

While the stories we tell are unimaginably diverse on the surface, if we go deeper we can spot distinct patterns and structures that emerge every single time. The content may vary, but the form of the stories we tell is remarkably predictable. Fairy tales are one way we have combated disorder in our history.

In Into The Woods, John Yorke suggests that the way we tell stories is indicative of our desire to find order in the world. Stories are an attempt to tame the terrifying randomness that surrounds us.

Yorke writes that “**every act of perception is an attempt to impose order, to make sense of a chaotic universe. Storytelling, at one level, is a manifestation of this process.**”
