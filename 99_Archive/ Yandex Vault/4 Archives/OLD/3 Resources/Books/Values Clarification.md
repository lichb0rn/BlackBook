# [[Values Clarification]]

This sort of Socratic questioning forms part of an approach called “values clarification,” which has been around since the 1970s but has recently gone through a resurgence of popularity among therapists and researchers. 

By deeply reflecting on our values each day and attempting to describe them concisely, we can develop a clearer sense of direction in life. You might do this by posing questions to yourself such as:

•  What’s ultimately the most important thing in life to you?
•  What do you really want your life to stand for or represent?
•  What do you want to be remembered for after you’re dead?
•  What sort of person do you most want to be in life?
•  What sort of character do you want to have?
•  What would you want written on your tombstone?

Another useful values clarification technique for students of [[Stoicism]] involves making two short lists in side-by-side columns headed “**Desired**” and “**Admired**”:

1. Desired. The things you most desire for yourself in life
2. Admired. The qualities you find most praiseworthy and admirable in other people

These two lists are, at first, virtually never identical. Why are they different, and how would your life change if you desired for yourself the qualities you find admirable in other people? As the Stoics might put it, what would happen if you were to make virtue your number one priority in life? The most important aspect of this values clarification exercise for Stoics would be to grasp the true nature of man’s highest good, to elucidate our most fundamental goal, and to live accordingly.

Reflecting upon and clarifying your core values can help combat depression and other emotional problems, especially once you make a consistent effort to live more in accord with your truest values each day. You can compare these values to the Stoic virtues and explore them from different perspectives by following the daily routine.
