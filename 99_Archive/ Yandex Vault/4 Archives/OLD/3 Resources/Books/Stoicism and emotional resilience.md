# [[Stoicism and emotional resilience]]

[[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed **there was a relationship between the sincere love of wisdom and greater emotional resilience.** Their philosophy contained within itself a moral and psychological therapy (*therapeia*) for minds troubled by anger, fear, sadness, and unhealthy desires. They called the goal of this therapy *apatheia*, meaning not apathy but rather freedom from harmful desires and emotions (passions).

Stoic philosophy trained to develop mental resilience through an ancient form of psychological therapy and self-improvement sometimes described as the Stoic **"therapy of the passions**", or how to maintain his equanimity by deliberately using language in the special therapeutic manner described by the Stoics.

[[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] reputedly told his students that the founders of Stoicism distinguished between two stages of our response to any event, including threatening situations. First come **the initial impressions (phantasiai) that are imposed involuntarily on our minds from outside**, when we are initially exposed to an event such as the storm at sea.

Even the mind of a perfect Stoic Sage will initially be shaken by abrupt shocks of this kind, and he will shrink back from them instinctively in alarm. This reaction doesn’t come from faulty value judgments about the dangers faced but from an emotional reflex arising in his body, which temporarily bypasses reason.

In the second stage of our response, the Stoics say, we typically add **voluntary judgments** of “assent” (sunkatatheseis) to these automatic impressions. Here the Stoic wise man’s response differs from that of the majority of people. He does not go along with the initial emotional reactions to a situation that have invaded his mind. Epictetus says the **Stoic should neither assent to nor confirm these emerging impressions**, such as anxiety in the face of danger. Rather, he rejects them as misleading, views them with studied indifference, and lets go of them.

[[Seneca]] gives a more detailed account of the Stoic model of emotion in On Anger, which divides the process of experiencing a passion into three “movements,” or stages:

- FIRST STAGE: Initial impressions automatically impose themselves on your mind, including thoughts and emerging feelings called propatheiai, or “proto-passions,” by the Stoics. For example, the impression “The boat is sinking” would quite naturally evoke some initial anxiety.

- SECOND STAGE: The majority of people, like those on the boat, would agree with the original impression, go along with it, and add more value judgments, indulging in catastrophic thinking: “I might die a terrible death!

By contrast, Stoics, like the unnamed philosopher in the story, have learned to take a step back from their initial thoughts and feelings and withhold their assent from them. They might do this by saying to themselves, “You are just an impression and not at all the things you claim to represent,” or “It is not things that upset us but our judgments about them.”

- THIRD STAGE: On the other hand, if you have assented to the impression that something is intrinsically bad or catastrophic, then a full-blown “passion” develops, which can quickly spiral out of control. This actually happened to Seneca during a storm when he grew seasick and panicked so much that he foolishly clambered overboard and tried to wade ashore through the waves and rocks when he would have been much safer remaining on the boat.

  
The Stoic likewise tells himself that although the situation may appear frightening, **the truly important thing in life is how he chooses to respond**. So he reminds himself to view the storm with Stoic indifference and to respond with wisdom and courage while accepting his initial nervous reaction as harmless and inevitable. What he does not do, though, is **make things worse for himself by continuing to worry**.

Seneca likewise noted that certain misfortunes strike the wise man without incapacitating him, such as physical pain, illness, the loss of friends or children, or the catastrophes inflicted by defeat in war. 

They graze him but do not wound him. Indeed, Seneca also points out that there is no virtue in enduring things we do not feel. This is important to note: for a Stoic to exhibit the virtue of temperance, he must have at least some trace of desire to renounce, and to exhibit courage he must have at least these first sensations of fear to endure. As the Stoics like to put it, the wise man is not made of stone or iron but of flesh and blood.
