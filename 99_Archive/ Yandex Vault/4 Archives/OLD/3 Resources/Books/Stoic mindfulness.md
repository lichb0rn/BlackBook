# [[Stoic mindfulness]]

If we wish to improve ourselves, [[Galen]] says that **we must never relax our vigilance**, not even for a single hour. How on earth do we do that? He explains that [[Zeno]] of Citium taught that “**we should act carefully in all things — just as if we were going to answer for it to our teachers shortly thereafter.**” 

That’s a rather clever mind trick that turns [[Stoicism|Stoic]] mentoring into a kind of mindfulness practice. Imagining that we’re being observed helps us to pay more attention to our own character and behavior.

[[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] told his students that, just as someone who walks barefoot is cautious not to step on a nail or twist his ankle, they **should be careful throughout the day not to harm their own character by lapsing into errors of moral judgment**.

In modern therapy, it’s common for clients who are making progress to wonder between sessions what their therapist might say about the thoughts they have. For example, they might be worrying about something and suddenly imagine the voice of their therapist challenging them with questions like “**Where’s the evidence for those fears being true?**” or “**How’s worrying like this actually working out for you?**”
