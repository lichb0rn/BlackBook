# [[Marcus Aurelius and pain]]

Although [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]], he also drew inspiration from another, more surprising source when it came to coping with pain and illness: the rival philosophical school of [[Epicurus]]. The [[Epicureans]] believed that the goal of life was pleasure (hedone). They described pleasure, though, in a notoriously paradoxical manner, as consisting mainly of a state of freedom from pain and suffering (ataraxia). Minimizing the emotional distress caused by pain and illness was therefore extremely important to them.

Marcus quotes this letter and then exhorts himself always to act as Epicurus did: remain focused on the pursuit of wisdom even in the face of illness, pain, or any other hardship.

**Our main concern should always remain the use we are making right now, from moment to moment, of our own mind.**

Marcus returns to the teachings of Epicurus concerning pain and illness several times in The [[Meditations]]. He’s particularly interested in one of Epicurus’s famous maxims, or Principal Doctrines, which contains advice for coping with pain. We should remind ourselves, Epicurus said, that **pain is always bearable because it is either acute or chronic but never both**.

In The Meditations, Marcus paraphrased the same quote from Epicurus as follows: “**On pain: if it is unbearable, it carries us off, if it persists, it can be endured**.”

When people are really struggling, they focus on their inability to cope and the feeling that the problem is spiraling out of control: “I just can’t bear this any longer!” This is a form of catastrophizing: focusing too much on the worst-case scenario and feeling overwhelmed. However, Epicurus meant that by focusing instead on the limits of your pain, whether in terms of duration or severity, you can develop a mind-set that’s more oriented toward coping and less overwhelmed by worry or negative emotions about your condition.

Pain wants to dominate your mind and become the whole story. However, people who handle pain well usually view it objectively, as something more limited in nature, which makes it easier for them to see themselves coping with it in various ways. Indeed, elsewhere in The Meditations, Marcus adds a Stoic twist to Epicurus’s saying. “**Pain is neither unendurable nor everlasting, if you keep its limits in mind and do not add to it through your own imagination.**”

The skills people use to cope with pain—even very severe pain—are similar to ones that can be used to deal with other uncomfortable sensations. For instance, during ordinary forms of physical exercise, such as jogging or yoga, there are opportunities to practice essentially the same coping strategies. We can learn to tolerate the harmless sensations of fatigue and discomfort experienced while doing these sorts of activities. Taking [[Cold Shower|cold showers]] also allows us to practice the same techniques.

**Everyday tolerance of minor physical discomforts can help us build lasting psychological resilience**, in other words.

Marcus tells himself:
>[!quote]
>Do away with the judgment, and the notion “I have been harmed” is done away with; do away with that notion, and the harm itself is gone.
