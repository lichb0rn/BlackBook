# [[How to speak wisely]]

**Always take the shortest route. The short way is the way of Nature, which leads to the soundest words and actions.** Simplicity frees us from affectation and the trouble it brings. For [[Stoicism|Stoics]], this honesty and simplicity of language requires two main things: conciseness and objectivity.

**The point at which our language starts evoking strong emotions is precisely when we start saying things that involve strong value judgments**, whether to others or ourselves. According to Stoic philosophy, **when we assign intrinsic values like “good” or “bad” to external events, we’re behaving irrationally** and even exhibiting a form of self-deception.


So how did the Stoics recommend we use language?
According to Diogenes Laertius, Stoic rhetoric identified five “virtues” of speech:

1. Correct grammar and good vocabulary
2. Clarity of expression, making the ideas easily understood
3. Conciseness, employing no more words than necessary
4. Appropriateness of style, suited to the subject matter and apparently also to the audience
5. Distinction, or artistic excellence, and the avoidance of vulgarity

Traditional rhetoric shared most of these values, with the notable exception of conciseness. 

The [[Sophists]], as we’ve seen, sought to persuade others by appealing to their emotions, typically in order to win praise. The Stoics, by contrast, placed supreme value on grasping and communicating the truth by appealing to reason.

The way we talk and think about events involves making value judgments, which shape our feelings. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]’s Hamlet exclaims, “**There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.**” 

The Stoics would agree that there’s nothing good or bad in the external world. Only what is up to us can be truly “good” or “bad,” which makes these terms synonymous with virtue and vice. Wisdom therefore consists in grasping external things objectively, as indifferent in this regard. Sometimes the Stoics describe this as staying with our initial impression of things before we impose value judgments.

[[Zeno]] coined the Stoic technical term “*phantasia kataleptike*” to refer to this Stoic way of viewing events objectively, separating value judgments from facts. [[Pierre Hadot]] translates it as “**[[Objective representation]]**”.


Marcus tends to refer to this way of viewing events as entailing **the separation of our value judgments from external events**. Cognitive therapists have likewise, for many decades, taught their clients the famous quotation from [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]]: “**It’s not things that upset us but our judgments about things,” which became an integral part of the initial orientation (“socialization”) of the client to the treatment approach**. This sort of technique is referred to as “[[Cognitive distancing|cognitive distancing]]” in [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]], because it requires sensing the separation or distance between our thoughts and external reality. Beck defined it as a “metacognitive” process, meaning a shift to a level of awareness involving “**thinking about thinking**.”
