# [[How to Conquer Anger]]

For [[Stoicism|Stoics]], full-blown anger is an irrational and unhealthy passion that we should never indulge. As we’ve seen, though, **it’s human nature to have some automatic feelings of irritation in response to life’s problems**. The Stoics consider these **“proto-passions” inevitable and accept their occurrence** with an attitude of indifference.

>The wise man will not get upset about things that lie beyond his direct control, such as other people’s actions.

Stoics believed that anger is a form of [[How to Conquer Desire|desire]]: “a desire for revenge on one who seems to have done an injustice inappropriately,” according to [[Diogenes Laertius]]. Speaking less formally, we might say that anger typically consists in the desire to harm someone because we think they’ve done wrong and deserve to be punished.

It’s often associated with the impression that you’ve somehow been threatened or harmed by the other person, making anger a close companion of fear: “He did something to me that he shouldn’t have done—that was wrong!” Not surprisingly, the Stoic antidote for anger resembles the general therapy applied to desire we described earlier. So it’s worth briefly reviewing the typical steps in this approach and considering how they would apply to this passion:

1. Self-monitoring. Spot early warning signs of anger, to nip it in the bud before it escalates.

2. [[Cognitive distancing]]. Remind yourself that the events themselves don’t make you angry, but rather your judgments about them cause the passion.

3. Postponement. Wait until your feelings of anger have naturally abated before you decide how to respond to the situation.

4. Modeling virtue. Ask yourself what a wise person such as [[Socrates]] or [[Zeno]] would do. What virtues might help you to respond wisely?

5. Functional analysis. Picture the consequences of following anger versus following reason and exercising virtues such as moderation.

In one of the most striking passages of [[Meditations|The Meditations]], [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] introduces a list of ten thinking strategies to use when “guarding against being angry with others.” He describes these anger-management techniques as ten gifts from [[Apollo]] and his nine Muses.

**1. WE ARE NATURALLY SOCIAL ANIMALS, DESIGNED TO HELP ONE ANOTHER**
In one of the most famous quotes from The [[Meditations]], the opening passage of book 2 mentioned earlier, Marcus describes **mentally preparing himself each morning to deal with troublesome people**.

**2. CONSIDER A PERSON’S CHARACTER AS A WHOLE**
The next strategy involves **picturing the person you’re angry with in a more rounded and complete manner**—**don’t just focus on the aspects of their character or behavior you find most annoying**. The idea is that we should broaden our awareness, not only thinking of the person’s actions that offend us but of the other person as a whole, remembering that **nobody is perfect.** 

**3. NOBODY DOES WRONG WILLINGLY**
This follows on from the previous point. It’s a statement of one of the central paradoxes of [[Socrates]]’s philosophy and was embraced by the Stoics: **no man does evil knowingly, which also entails that no man does it willingly**.

As [[Socrates]] pointed out, nobody wants to make mistakes or be deceived; all reasoning creatures inherently desire the truth. So if someone is genuinely mistaken about what is right, you should, if anything, feel sorry for them.

**4. NOBODY IS PERFECT, YOURSELF INCLUDED**
Remembering that other people are human, and flawed, can help you to receive criticism (or praise) from them in a more balanced and less emotional way. In a similar manner, reminding yourself that **you’re not perfect** either—none of us are—can help you to moderate your feelings of anger.

**5. YOU CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN OF OTHER PEOPLE’S MOTIVES**
We can’t read other people’s minds, so **we shouldn’t jump to conclusions about what their intentions are**. However, without knowing someone’s intentions, we can never really be sure they’re doing wrong.

**Anger assumes an unwarranted certainty about the motives of other people**. [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|Cognitive therapists]] call this the fallacy of “**mind-reading**”—leaping to conclusions about other people’s motives although they are always somewhat veiled from us. You should always remain open to the possibility that the other person’s intentions are not in the wrong. Consider that other plausible interpretations of their actions exist. Keeping an open mind will help you dilute your feelings of anger.

**6. REMEMBER WE ALL WILL DIE**
When viewed from this perspective, it doesn’t seem worth getting flustered by people’s behavior. **Nothing lasts forever**. If events will seem trivial in the future when we look back on them, then why should we care strongly about them now? This doesn’t mean that we should do nothing. Indeed, **by remaining calm, we can plan our response better and take action**.

**7. IT’S OUR OWN JUDGMENT THAT UPSETS US**
When you’re angry, remind yourself that it’s not things or other people that make you angry but your judgments about them. **If you can let go of your value judgments and stop calling other people’s actions “awful,” then your anger will diminish**. Of course, as [[Seneca]] pointed out, there are initial feelings of anger that we can’t control, which the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] call the proto-passions (propatheiai). We don’t control our initial reaction, perhaps, but we do control how we respond to it: **it’s not what happens first that matters but what you do next.**

**8. ANGER DOES US MORE HARM THAN GOOD**
Marcus often links gaining [[Cognitive distancing|cognitive distance]] with the next technique, which we’ve called **functional analysis**. **Think about the consequences of responding with anger and compare them to those of responding rationally**, calmly, and perhaps with empathy and kindness. Alternatively, just remind yourself that anger actually does you more harm than good.

**9. NATURE GAVE US THE VIRTUES TO DEAL WITH ANGER**
[[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] also recommends applying another familiar [[Stoicism|Stoic]] technique to anger, the one we’ve called **contemplation of virtue**. You should ask yourself **what virtue or capacity Nature has given you to cope with the situation you’re facing**.

Marcus says that you should accept that wrongdoing inevitably exists in the world and then ask, “What virtue has Nature given man as a response to the wrongdoing in question?” He explains this by comparing virtues to medicines prescribed by Nature as the “antidotes” to vice. The main antidote to anger for Marcus is the Stoic **virtue of kindness**, which along with fairness makes up the cardinal social virtue of justice.

For Stoics, kindness first and foremost means educating others or wishing they would become wise, free from vice and passion.

Marcus’s example of acting with kindness actually entails educating the other person in two of the most important strategies he mentioned earlier:
1. Anger does more harm to us than to the person with whom we’re angry.
2. Humans are essentially social creatures; **Nature didn’t intend us to fight but to help each other.** 

**10. IT’S MADNESS TO EXPECT OTHERS TO BE PERFECT**
Marcus describes these first nine strategies as gifts from Apollo’s Muses, which he says we should take to heart. He adds one more piece of advice from the Leader of the Muses himself: **to expect bad people not to do bad things is madness** because that is wishing for the impossible. Moreover, to accept their wrongdoing toward others while expecting them never to wrong you is both inconsiderate and foolish.
