# [[Reciprocity]]

Reciprocity teaches us why win-win relationships are the way to go, why waiters leave candies with the bill, why it’s a good idea to use the least force possible to secure an outcome, and why a lot of companies don’t permit their employees to accept gifts. 

In physics, reciprocity is Newton’s [[Третий закон Ньютона|third law]], which states that **for every force exerted by object A on object B, there is an equal but opposite force exerted by object B on object A.** Every force involves the interaction of two objects where the force asserted by one is reciprocated with an equally powerful and directionally opposite force by the other object.

In the natural world, this third law of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]’s explains jet propulsion. The word propulsion comes from two Latin terms meaning “forward” and “drive”—propulsion is a force that drives an object forward. Jet propulsion works by forcing matter, such as gas produced by burning fuel, in one direction, leading to a corresponding movement of the vehicle in the opposite direction.

Jet propulsion only works if the forward push is stronger than the forces acting on the object, like air friction and its own weight. The greater the force in comparison to drag (the amount of force opposing the motion), the faster the object can move.

Reciprocity can be summed up like this: **when you act on things, they act on you.**

## The rise of the "win-win"

In the biological world, reciprocity doesn’t have the same perfect record.

Evolutionary biologists argue that our tendency to engage in reciprocal behavior is a natural product of evolution. **You are more likely to survive if you receive help from others.** And you are more likely to receive that help if you have offered assistance in the past. So the genes that encode the reciprocal instinct were more likely to be passed on.

Humans engage in two types of reciprocity with each other: direct, which is “I help you and you help me;” and indirect, which is either a pay-it-forward concept, “I help you and then you help someone else,” or more about reputation building—“I help you, building a reputation as one who helps, so that someone else helps me in the future.

If you want to get an idea of the true value of engaging in positive reciprocal behavior, just make a list of your outcomes in any given week. Life is easier and more enjoyable when we act on starting and maintaining win-win relationships with everyone.
