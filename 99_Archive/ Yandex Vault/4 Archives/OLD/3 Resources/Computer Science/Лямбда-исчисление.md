# [[Лямбда-исчисление]]

In lambda calculus terms, a function can look like $λx.2*x$. 

The understanding is that the variable after the $λ$ character (the Greek letter lambda in lowercase) is the parameter for the function, and the expression after the dot is where you would replace whatever value is passed as an argument. Later in this chapter, we will see that this particular example could be written as (x) => 2*x in JavaScript in arrow function form, which, as you can see, is very similar.

Applying a function means you provide an actual argument to it, which is written in the usual way, using parentheses. For example, $(λx.2*x)(3)$ would be calculated as $6$

In lambda calculus, you don’t write functions with several parameters, but only one; you do this using a technique called [[Currying|currying]].
