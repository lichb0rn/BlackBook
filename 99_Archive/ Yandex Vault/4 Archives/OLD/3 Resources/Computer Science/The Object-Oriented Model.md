# [[The Object-Oriented Model]]

Increasingly complex real-world problems demonstrated a need for a data model that more closely represented the real world. In the object-oriented data model (OODM), both data and its relationships are contained in a single structure known as an object. In turn, the OODM is the basis for the object-oriented database management system (OODBMS).

An object includes information about relationships between the facts within the object, as well as information about its relationships with other objects. Therefore, the facts within the object are given greater meaning. The OODM is said to be a [[Semantic Data|semantic data]] model because semantic indicates meaning.

The OO data model is based on the following components:
- An object is an abstraction of a real-world entity. In general terms, an object may be considered equivalent to an [[Entity-Relationship|ER]] model’s entity. More precisely, an object represents only one occurrence of an entity. 
 - Attributes describe the properties of an object.
 - Objects that share similar characteristics are grouped in classes. A class is a collection of similar objects with shared structure (attributes) and behavior (methods). In a general sense, a class resembles the ER model’s entity set. However, a class is different from an entity set in that it contains a set of procedures known as methods.
