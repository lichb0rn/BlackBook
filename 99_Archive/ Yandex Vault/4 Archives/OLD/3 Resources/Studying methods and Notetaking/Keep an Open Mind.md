# [[Keep an Open Mind]]

While selectivity is the key to smart note-taking, it is equally important to be selective in a smart way. Unfortunately, our brains are not very smart in selecting information by default.

We are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know. 

The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search
