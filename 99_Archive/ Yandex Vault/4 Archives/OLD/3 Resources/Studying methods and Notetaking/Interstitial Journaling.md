# [[Interstitial Journaling]]

Interstitial Journaling (IJ) was introduced by [[Tony Stubblebine]]. His idea was straightforward: **rather than tracking your work with a to-do list, why not track it with a journal?** Though this may sound similar to [Rapid Logging](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers), it’s different, and they complement each other beautifully. IJ fills in the missing piece: the when.

IJ can minimize the impact of context switching by introducing a small protocol. Rather than randomly journaling your experiences, or waiting until the end of the day, IJ encourages you to write down the following every time you complete what we're doing:

1. The time
2. A few thoughts about what you worked on last
3. A few thoughts about what you will work on next
