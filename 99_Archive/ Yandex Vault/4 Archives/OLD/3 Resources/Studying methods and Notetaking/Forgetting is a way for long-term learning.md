# [[Forgetting is a way for long-term learning]]

The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas. 

**Transferring ideas into the external memory** also allows us to forget them. And even though
it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually **facilitates long-term learning**.

Forgetting would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism [[Active Inhibition|active inhibition]. It is easy to understand what it is good for: **Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings**.
