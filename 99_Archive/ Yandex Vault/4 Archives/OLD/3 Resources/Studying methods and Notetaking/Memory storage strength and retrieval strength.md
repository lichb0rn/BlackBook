# [[Memory storage strength and retrieval strength]]

Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: **Storage strength** and **retrieval strength** (Bjork 2011). 

They speculate that storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one’s lifetime. We add more and more information to our long-term memory.

If we look at the current state of education, especially the learning strategies most students employ, we see that **the vast majority of all learning still aims to improve “storage strength,”** even though **it cannot be improved**. It is still mostly about remembering isolated facts and not so much about building connections. This is what learning psychologists have rightfully given the derogative term **“cramming:” the attempt to reinforce and solidify information in the brain by repetition**.

What does help for true, **useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts** as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other.
