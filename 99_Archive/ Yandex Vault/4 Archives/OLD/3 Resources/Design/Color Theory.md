# [[Color Theory]]

## Color Wheel
The first color wheel was designed by Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in the 1600s. Designers still use it today to mix and match colors to build a palette.

- 3 основных цвета: красный, желтый и синий.
- 3 вторичных цвета: зелёный, оранжевый, фиолетовый
- 6 третичных цветов.

### Hue (тон)
Hue is the name of the color: red, blue, green, yellow, orange and so on.

### Saturation (насыщенность)
Saturation is the intensity or purity of a hue. High saturation makes a color look bright and vibrant, whereas a desaturated color is more washed out and subtle.

### Value
Value determines the degree of darkness or lightness of a hue, ranging from pure white to pure black.

### Shade (тень)
A shade is a hue produced by adding black in varying amounts. The image below shows various shades of red with increasing amounts of black added to it.

### Color temperature (цветовая температура)
Divide the color wheel vertically into two halves. The colors on the left half are the warm colors — reds, oranges and yellows. The ones on the right half are the cool colors — purples, blues and greens.

### Contrast (контраст)
In color theory, contrast is the difference in the visual properties of an object that distinguishes it from other objects and its own background. In other words, it’s the difference between two colors. See [[Contrast in Design]].
