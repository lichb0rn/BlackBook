# [[Contrast in Design]]

In [[Software Development MOC|web]] and [[iOS Development|mobile]] design, using contrasting colors is essential to ensuring accessibility and readability. You must always strive to create designs that have a strong contrast between the content and background to ensure users with visual impairments aren’t left out.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 recommends a minimum contrast ratio of
- 4.5:1 for regular text
- 3:1 for large text, graphics and user interface components.

There are several online tools available to check the contrast ratios of your colors, like WebAIM’s contrast checker: webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.
