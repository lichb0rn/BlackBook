# PARA

I eventually named this organizing system **PARA**, which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: **Projects**, **Areas**, **Resources**, and **Archives**.

PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.</mark> The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files.

Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: “In which project will this be most useful?” It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.

If there isn’t a current project that your note would be useful for, we have a couple of other options of where to put it, including dedicated places for each of the main “areas” of your life that you are responsible for, and “resources,” which is like a personal library of references, facts, and inspiration.

With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be placed into one of just four categories:

1. Projects: Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.
2. Areas: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
3. Resources: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
4. Archives: Inactive items from the other three categories.

Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA comes into play.

The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible:

- Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.
- Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.
- Resources may become actionable depending on the situation.
- Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.

This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down:

1.  In which project will this be most useful?
2.  If none: In which area will this be most useful?
3.  If none: Which resource does this be long to?
4.  If none: Place in archives.
