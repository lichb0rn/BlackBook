# [[Weekly Review]]

- From a practical standpoint, here is the three-part drill that can get you there: **get clear**, **get current,** and **get creative**. 
	- Getting clear will ensure that all your collected stuff is processed. 
	- Getting current will ensure that all your orienting “maps” or lists are reviewed and up-to-date. 
	- The creative part happens to some degree automatically, as you get clear and current—you will naturally be generating ideas and perspectives that will be adding value to your thinking about work and life.

### Get Clear
Get “In” to Empty Review any meeting notes and miscellaneous scribbles on notepaper or in your mobile devices. Decide and list any action items, projects, waiting-fors, calendar events, and someday/maybes, as appropriate. File any reference notes and materials. Get the “in” areas of e-mails, texts, and voice mails to zero.”

Empty Your Head Put into writing or text (in appropriate categories) any new projects, action items, waiting-fors, someday/maybes, and so forth that you haven’t yet captured and clarified.

### Get Current
You need to “pull up the rear guard” now and eliminate outdated reminders in your system and get your active lists up-to-date and complete. Here are the steps:
- Review “Next Actions” Lists Mark off completed actions.
- Review Previous Calendar 
	- Data Review the past two to three weeks of calendar entries in detail for remaining or emergent action items, reference information, and so on, and transfer that data into the active system. Grab every “Oh! That reminds me . . . !” with its associated actions. You will likely notice meetings and events that you attended, which trigger thoughts of what to do next about the content.
- Review Upcoming Calendar
	- Look at further calendar entries (long-and short-term). Capture actions about projects and preparations required for upcoming events.
	- Upcoming travel, conferences, meetings, holidays, etc. should be assessed for projects to add to your “Projects” and “Next Actions” lists for any of those situations that are already on your radar but not yet on cruise control.
- Review “Waiting For”
	- List Any needed follow-up? Need to send an e-mail to get a status on it? Need to add an item to someone’s Agenda list to update when you’ll talk with him or her? Record any next actions.
- Review “Projects” (and “Larger Outcome”) 
	- Lists Evaluate the status of projects, goals, and outcomes, one by one, ensuring that at least one current kick-start action for each is in your system.
- Review Any Relevant Checklists
	- Is there anything else that you haven’t done, that you need or want to do, given your various engagements, interests, and responsibilities?

### Get Creative
- The challenge is not to be creative—it’s to eliminate the barriers to the natural flow of our creative energies. 
- Practically speaking, it’s about getting your act together, letting spontaneous ideas emerge, capturing them, and utilizing their value. 
	- If you, in the process of reading and applying any of these techniques, have had any kind of “Aha! That reminds me . . .” or “Hmmm, I think I might want to . . . ,” because you externalized your thinking and reflected on it, then you’re already demonstrating the naturalness of this process.

- Review “Someday/Maybe”
	- List Check for any projects that may have become more interesting or valuable to activate, and transfer them to Projects. 
	- Delete any that have simply stayed around much longer than they should, as the world and your interest have changed enough to take them off even this informal radar. 
	- Add any emerging possibilities that you’ve just started thinking about.
- Be Creative and Courageous 
	- Are there any new, wonderful, harebrained, creative, thought-provoking, risk-taking ideas you can capture and add into your system, or “external brain”?

## From [[Building a Second Brain]]

Here is my own Weekly Review Checklist, which I usually complete every three to seven days depending on how busy a given week is. The point isn’t to follow a rigid schedule, but to make it a habit to empty my inboxes and clear my digital workspaces on a regular basis to keep them from getting overwhelmed.

1. Clear my email inbox.
2. Check my calendar.
3. Clear my computer desktop.
4. Clear my notes inbox.
5. Choose my tasks for the week.
