# [[GTD Organize]]

There are seven primary types of things that you’ll want to keep track of and manage from an organizational and operational perspective:
- A Projects list
- Project support material
- Calendar actions and information
- Next Actions lists
- A Waiting For list
- Reference material
- A Someday/Maybe list

## Calendar
The calendar should show only the “**hard landscape**” around which you do the rest of your actions. One of the three uses of a calendar is for day-specific information.

Here are a few of the myriad things you should consider inserting:
- Triggers for activating projects
- Events you might want to participate in
- Decision catalysts

Triggers for Activating Projects If you have a project that you don’t really need to think about now but that deserves a flag at some point in the future, you can pick an appropriate date and put a reminder about the project in your calendar for that day.

Decision Catalysts Once in a while there may be a significant decision that you need to make but can’t (or don’t want to) right away.


## Context
The best way to be reminded of an “as soon as I can” action is by the particular **context** required for that action—that is, either the tool or the location or the situation needed to complete it.

Common list headings:
- Calls
- At Computer
- Errands
- At Office
- At Home
- Anywhere
- Agendas
- Read/Review

## Project Lists
The Projects list **is not meant to hold plans or details about your projects** themselves, nor should you try to keep it arranged by priority or size or urgency—it’s just a comprehensive index of your open loops. You actually won’t be working off of the Projects list during your moment-to-moment activities; for the most part, your calendar, action lists, and any unexpected tasks that come up will constitute your tactical and immediate focus.

### Some Common Ways to Subsort Projects
- *Personal/Professional*
	- Many people feel more comfortable seeing their lists divided up between personal and professional projects.
- *Delegated Projects*
- *Specific Types of Projects*
	- For example, a corporate trainer or a keynote speaker might maintain a separate category of “Projects—Presentations,” with a chronological listing of all the upcoming events of that nature.

## Someday/Maybe
Someday/Maybes are not throwaway items. They may be some of the most interesting and creative things you’ll ever get involved with. There are several ways to stage things for later review, all of which will work to get them off your current radar and your mind.

### Someday/Maybe list
Recommendation is that you create a Someday/Maybe list in whatever organizing system you’ve chosen. Then give yourself permission to populate that list with all the items of that type that have occurred to you so far. You’ll probably discover that simply having the list and starting to fill it out will cause you to come up with all kinds of creative ideas.

>[!note]
>Activating and maintaining your Someday/Maybe category unleashes the flow of your creative thinking—you have permission to imagine cool things to do without having to commit to doing anything about them yet.

**We’re likely to seize opportunities when they arise if we’ve already identified and captured them as a possibility.**

#### Make an Inventory of Your Creative Imaginings
**Typical categories include:**
- Things to get or build for your home
- Hobbies to take up
- Skills to learn
- Creative expressions to explore
- Clothes and accessories to buy
- Toys (hi-tech and otherwise!) to acquire
- Trips to take
- Organizations to join
- Service projects to contribute to
- Things to see and do
**Reassess Your Current Projects** 
	Now’s a good time to review your Projects list from a more elevated perspective (that is, the standpoint of your job, goals, and personal commitments) and consider whether you might transfer some of your current commitments to Someday/Maybe. If on reflection you realize that an optional project doesn’t have a chance of getting your attention for the next few months or more, move it to this list.


## Checklists: Creative and Constructive Reminders

Many years ago Alfred North Whitehead cogently observed, “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” Checklists provide the micro version of that macro observation: whenever you have to think about anything, either because of some regularity of a refreshed view (“At the end of every calendar year, I want/need to . . .”) or a specific situation that requires more detail than you can easily recall (“Before I deliver a seminar, I need to . . .”), you should entrust those jobs to your “external mind”—your management system that holds the details you need to engage with at appropriate times.

Be open to creating any kind of checklist as the urge strikes you. A list of some of the topics of checklists I’ve seen and used over the years:
- Job Areas of Responsibility (key responsibility areas)
- Exercise Regimens (muscle resistance training programs)
- Travel Checklist (everything to take on or do before a trip)
- Weekly Review (everything to review and/or update on a weekly basis)
- Training Program Components (all the things to handle when putting on an event, front to back)
- Key Clients
- People to Stay in Touch With (all the people you might want to connect with in your network)
- Year-end Activities (all the actions for closing up for the time period)
- Personal Development (things to evaluate regularly to ensure personal balance and progress)
- Jokes
