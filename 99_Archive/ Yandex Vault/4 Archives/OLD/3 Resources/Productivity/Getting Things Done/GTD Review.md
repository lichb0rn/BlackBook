# [[GTD Review]]

You must be assured that you’re doing what you need to be doing, and that it’s OK to be not doing what you’re not doing.

1. Look at Your Calendar First . . .
	Your most frequent review will probably be of your daily calendar to see the “hard landscape” and assess what has to get done.

2. Then Your Action Lists
	After you review all your day-and time-specific commitments and handle whatever you need to about them, your next most frequent area for review will be the lists of all the actions you could possibly do in your current context. If you’re in your office, for instance, you’ll look at your lists of calls, computer actions, and in-office things to do. This doesn’t necessarily mean you will be doing anything on those lists; you’ll just evaluate them against the flow of other work coming at you to ensure that you make the best choices about what to deal with.

The real trick **to ensuring the trustworthiness of the whole organization system** lies in **regularly refreshing** your thinking and your system from a more elevated perspective. **If your system is out of date, your brain will be forced to fully engage again** at the lower level of remembering. The magic key to the sustainability of the process is the [[Weekly Review]].
