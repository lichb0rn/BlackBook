# Weekly and Monthly Reviews

The practice of conducting a “[[Weekly Review]]” was pioneered by executive coach and author [[David Allen]] in his influential book [[Getting Things Done]].

He described a Weekly Review as a regular check-in, performed once a week, in which you intentionally reset and review your work and life. Allen recommends using a Weekly Review to write down any new to-dos, review your active projects, and decide on priorities for the upcoming week.

While the Weekly Review is grounded and practical, I recommend doing a
[[Monthly Review]] that is a bit more reflective and holistic.
