# [[Can virtue be taught]]

Can virtue be taught, or are people born with whatever virtue they have? Not only did the ancient Greeks debate this issue in detail, but modern biology and developmental psychology have uncovered a significant amount of empirical evidence that is very relevant to it.

In [[Plato]]’s Meno, [[Socrates]] is asked by the character bearing that name: “Can you tell me, Socrates, **is human excellence something teachable?** Or, if not teachable, is it something to be acquired by training? Or, if it cannot be acquired either by training or by teaching, does it accrue to me at birth or in some other way?” After a lengthy discussion, Socrates concludes that **“excellence” (or virtue) may be teachable in principle, but as there are no teachers of it to be found anywhere, in practice it is not.** The implication, then, is that **people who have it probably acquire a propensity for it as an endowment at birth**.

**[[Aristotle]], however, had different ideas**. He made a crucial distinction between **moral virtue and intellectual virtue**, the former arising from both natural disposition and habit acquired while growing up and the latter resulting from reflection in a mature mind. It follows, then, that there are three sources of virtue: some comes from our natural endowment, some is obtained by habit, especially early in life, and some can be acquired intellectually and therefore can be taught.

This “mixed” model of the acquisition of virtue happens to work well with Stoic philosophy and is also favored by modern research in cognitive psychology. **The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] held a developmental model of morality,** thinking that **we naturally come equipped with the ability to have regard not just for ourselves but also for our caretakers and other people with whom we come into regular contact early on in life**. Once the age of reason arrives, however, when we are about seven or eight years old, we can begin to further **build our virtuous character by two means: habit** and (more so later in life) **explicit philosophical reflection**.
