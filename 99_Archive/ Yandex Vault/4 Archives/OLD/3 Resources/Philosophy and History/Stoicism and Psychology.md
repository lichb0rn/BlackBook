# [[Stoicism and Psychology]]

[[Stoicism]] is the **philosophical root of a number of evidence-based psychological therapies**, including [[Viktor Frankl]]’s **logotherapy** and [[Albert Ellis]]’s **rational emotive behavior therapy.**

Also owing a significant debt to Stoicism is the increasingly diverse family of practices that goes under the general rubric of **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**, which was initially deployed to treat depression and now is more widely applied to a variety of mental conditions.

[[Aaron T. Beck]], author of **Cognitive Therapy of Depression**, **acknowledges this debt** when he writes, “**The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers.**”
