# [[Epictetus about suicide]]

>[!quote] [[Эпиктет]]
>if it is not to your profit, the door stands open: if it is to your profit, bear it. For in every event the door must stand open and then we have no trouble,” he calmly replied. The “open door” was the standard phrase he used with his students whenever he wanted to talk about suicide. Suppose someone made the room smoke. If the smoke is moderate I will stay: if excessive, I go out: for one must remember and hold fast to this, that the door is open. The order comes, ‘Do not dwell in Nicopolis.’ I will not. ‘Nor in Athens.’ I give up Athens. ‘Nor in Rome.’ I give up Rome. ‘Dwell in Gyara.’ I dwell in Gyara: but this seems to me a very smoky room indeed, and I depart where no one shall hinder me from dwelling: for that dwelling is open to every man.

Walk through the “door” is a matter of personal judgment, pertinent to specific situations. If the situation is truly unbearable for you, then you have the option to leave. Second, and crucially, the door must stand open and then we will have no trouble: what will make it possible for us to withstand harsh conditions and very difficult periods in our lives will be precisely that we always have an alternative course of action at our disposal.
