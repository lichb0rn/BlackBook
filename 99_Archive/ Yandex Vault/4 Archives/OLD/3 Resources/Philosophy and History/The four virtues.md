# [[The four virtues]]

The **Stoics derived their understanding of virtue from Socrates**, who believed that all virtues are actually different aspects of the same underlying feature: wisdom. The reason why wisdom is the “chief good,” according to [[Socrates]], is rather simple: it is the only human ability that is good under every and all circumstances.

The Stoics adopted Socrates’s classification of four aspects of virtue, which they thought of as four tightly interlinked character traits: **(practical) wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice.**

One crucial feature of the Stoic (and Socratic) conception of virtue is that the different **virtues cannot be practiced independently**: one cannot be both intemperate and courageous, in the Stoic-Socratic meaning of the term. Although it makes perfect sense for us to say that, for instance, an individual has shown courage in battle and yet regularly drinks to excess or is ill-tempered, for the Stoics that person would not be virtuous, because virtue is an all-or-nothing package.

Other cultures have developed, more or less independently, their own sets of virtues as socially important character traits, each arriving at its own classification of the relations among virtues. Interestingly, though, **there is much more convergence than we would expect** in these days when cultural relativism is so often portrayed as the norm. 

A study by [[Katherine Dahlsgaard]], [[Christopher Peterson]], and [[Martin Seligman]] looked at how virtue is articulated in [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Confucianism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Taoism]], and what they call “Athenian philosophy” (mostly [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]). They found a rather surprising amount of congruence among all of these religious-philosophical traditions and identified a set of six “core” virtues:

-   Courage: Emotional strengths that involve the exercise of will to accomplish goals in the face of opposition, external or internal; examples include bravery, perseverance, and authenticity (honesty).
-   Justice: Civic strengths that underlie healthy community life; examples include fairness, leadership, and citizenship or teamwork.
-   Humanity: Interpersonal strengths that involve “tending and befriending” others; examples include love and kindness.
-   Temperance: Strengths that protect against excess; examples include forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-control.
-   Wisdom: Cognitive strengths that entail the acquisition and use of knowledge; examples include creativity, curiosity, judgment, and perspective (providing counsel to others).
-   Transcendence: Strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and thereby provide meaning; examples include gratitude, hope, and spirituality.
