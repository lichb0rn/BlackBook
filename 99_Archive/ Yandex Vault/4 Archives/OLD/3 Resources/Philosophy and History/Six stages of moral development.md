# [[Six stages of moral development]]

In modern psychology, perhaps the most famous attempt to summarize how people develop morally is [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]’s theory of six stages of moral development, which builds on [[Jean Piaget]]’s original work, as well as on a significant amount of modern empirical evidence. The six stages described by Kohlberg are grouped into three phases: **pre-conventional morality** (which begins with a stage regulated by obedience and punishment and then moves to a stage of self-orientation), **conventional morality** (from a stage of interpersonal accord and conformity to one of maintenance of social order and response to authority), and **post-conventional morality** (from a stage of response to a perceived social contract to one of adherence to universal ethical principles).

Kohlberg’s theory has been criticized on a number of levels, including too much emphasis on rational decision-making and on the ethical concept of justice (as opposed to, respectively, the role of instinctual judgments and of other ethical virtues, such as care for others). But it does seem to hold fairly well across cultures, even though people go through the different stages at different rates, and distinct cultures emphasize some aspects of the model more than others.

This theory is in accord with repeated findings by biologists who study gene-environment interactions in a variety of living organisms: complex traits, especially behavioral ones, seem almost always to develop through a continuous feedback of genes and environments, nature intermingled with nurture. And of course, for human beings a major aspect of the environment is our culture and our social interactions with other members of our species.
