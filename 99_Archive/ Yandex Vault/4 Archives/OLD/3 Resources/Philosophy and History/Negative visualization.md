# [[Negative visualization]]

Modern [[Stoicism|Stoics]] call negative visualization. The basic idea, again adopted by modern cognitive behavioral therapy and similar approaches, is to **regularly focus on potentially bad 
 scenarios, repeating to yourself that they are not in fact as bad as they may seem**, because you have the inner resources to deal with them. The negative visualization exercise, what the ancient Romans called *premeditatio malorum* (literally, foreseeing bad stuff), may focus on something as mundane as the irritation you feel when someone cuts you off in traffic or on events as critical as the death of a loved one, or even your own.

Now, why would anyone, let alone someone who is depressed, want to imagine the worst on purpose? Well, for one thing there is the empirical observation that it actually works: **visualizing negative happenings decreases our fear of them and mentally prepares us to deal with the crisis when and if it ensues.** But there is a flip side to visualizing the negative: we gain a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for all the times when bad things do not happen to us, when we leisurely drive down the road on a beautiful day or enjoy the presence of our loved ones because they are very much alive and well.
