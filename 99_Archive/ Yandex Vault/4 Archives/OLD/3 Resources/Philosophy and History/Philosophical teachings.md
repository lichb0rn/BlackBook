# [[Philosophical teachings]]

While modern ethics is essentially concerned with which actions are right or wrong, premodern philosophers conceived of ethics as the much broader inquiry into how to live a happy life, the pursuit of which they deemed to be a human being’s most important endeavor. But a happy life can be pursued in different ways, depending on which concept of eudaimonia—the flourishing life—one adopts. The major Hellenistic schools of philosophy differed primarily on just this point.

As you can see, it all began with [[Socrates]]. Stemming from different interpretations of his teachings, a trio of schools arose: [[Plato]]’s Academy, [[Aristippus]]’s Cyrenaics, and [[Antisthenes]]’s Cynicism. Aristotelianism originated from within the Academy (which Aristotle frequented), Cyrenaism led to Epicureanism, and Cynicism birthed Stoicism—although the actual relationships among all these schools are best thought of as many-to-many rather than in terms of linear descent, given the reciprocal influences that took place over centuries.

[[Socraticism]]: We know what Socrates taught mostly (though not exclusively) from the early Platonic dialogues (for example, Laches, Charmides, and Protagoras). His was the prototype of the ethical approaches to virtue in which wisdom is the Chief Good, the only thing that is always good because it is necessary to make proper use of everything else. For Socrates, our moral imperative is to examine our life, and reason is our best guide in doing so. The eudaimonic life, according to him, consists in acting in the right way, and evil is the result of ignorance, or *amathia* (in other words, nobody purposefully wants to do bad things).


[[Platonism]] (the Academy): [[Plato]], in the later dialogues, maintained crucial aspects of [[Socrates]]’s view (critically, that the eudaimonic life is one of practicing virtue), while at the same time adding a number of metaphysical notions and recasting things in terms of his famous theory of Forms, where the abstract and idealized Form of the Good is the transcendent principle of all goodness. He eventually subordinated individual flourishing to societal needs, as in the Republic, where the ideal state reflects the tripartite division of the human soul, and philosophers, naturally, are in charge of it—just as reason is in charge of the “spirited” and “appetitive” parts of the individual soul.


[[Aristotelianism]] (the Peripatetic school, the Lyceum): For [[Aristotle]] too, the point of life was to achieve eudaimonia through the practice of the virtues (of which he identified a whopping twelve). In [[Aristotle]]’s view, there is a proper function for everything in the world, including humans: our proper function is to use reason, so using reason well is the way to live a eudaimonic life. However, we also need some external goods, such as a supportive family and societal environment, some degree of education, health, and wealth, and even some good looks. Crucially, then, being able to live a eudaimonic life is not entirely within the grasp of the agent: some luck, in the form of favorable circumstances, is also needed.

  
[[Cyrenaism]]: [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene was, tellingly enough, the first of [[Socrates]]’s disciples to actually take money for his services. For him, the primary purpose of life was not long-term happiness but rather the moment-to-moment experience of bodily pleasures. To achieve this, one needs practical virtue, but only instrumentally, in order to seek pleasure. Still, we shouldn’t think of the Cyrenaics as simply being into sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll, but rather as seeking what might be called enlightened hedonism. As [[Aristippus]] put it: “I possess, but I am not possessed.” Self-control was important in order to maintain cheerfulness while making the best of every situation.


[[Epicureanism]] (the Garden): [[Epicurus]] too taught that life is about increasing one’s pleasure and (especially) reducing one’s pain. But Epicurean hedonism was much more sophisticated than its Cyrenaic counterpart (despite later Christian smearing, deployed in a successful attempt to fight a threatening rival sect). For one thing, it included mental pleasures, which were considered superior to bodily ones, and happiness was not just a moment-by-moment thing but a lifelong process. The Epicurean way included freeing oneself from prejudice (especially of a religious nature), mastering one’s desires, living a modest life, and cultivating friendship. Crucially, however, Epicureans counseled withdrawal from social and political life (because it was much more likely to bring about pain than pleasure).

  
[[Cynicism]]: According to [[Antisthenes]] of Athens, the founder of the Cynic school, virtue understood as practical wisdom is not only necessary for a eudaimonic life but also sufficient. That is why the Cynics took the already rather frugal Socratic lifestyle to an extreme. Think of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], Antisthenes’s student, who famously lived in a tub, begged for a living, and flaunted just about any social convention. Many Stoics admired the Cynics, and our friend [[Epictetus]] devoted the long chapter 22 of the third book of his [[Discourses]] to an encomium of Cynicism. As he put it, if you really can’t be a Cynic, at least be a Stoic.

  
[[Stoicism]]: [[Zeno]] of Citium, the founder of [[Stoicism]], learned his philosophy initially from [[Crates]], who was a Cynic and disciple of [[Diogenes of Sinope]]. As the reader by now knows well, Stoicism struck a middle ground between Aristotelianism and Cynicism, while at the same time strongly rejecting Epicureanism. The Stoics granted to the Cynics that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for happiness, but also nodded toward the Peripatetics in recovering (some) interest in external goods, which they classified into preferred and dispreferred indifferents, to be pursued, or avoided, so long as they do not compromise one’s integrity of character.
