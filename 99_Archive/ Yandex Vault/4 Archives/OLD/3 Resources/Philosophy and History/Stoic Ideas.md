# [[Stoic Ideas]]

**[[Stoicism]], like any life philosophy, may not appeal to or work for everyone.**  

**It is rather demanding**, **stipulating that moral character** is the only truly worthy thing to cultivate; **health, education, and even wealth are considered “preferred indifferents**.

**Stoicism is eminently democratic**, cutting across social classes: whether you are rich or poor, healthy or sick, educated or ignorant, **it makes no difference to your ability to live a moral life** and thus **achieve what the Stoics called ataraxia**, or **tranquillity of mind**.

To a Stoic, it ultimately does not matter if we think the Logos is God or Nature, as long as we recognize that **a decent human life is about the cultivation of one’s character and concern for other people** (and even for Nature itself) and is best enjoyed by way of a proper—but not fanatical—**detachment from mere worldly goods**.

The original Stoicism, for instance, was a comprehensive philosophy that included not only ethics but also a metaphysics, a natural science, and specific approaches to logic and epistemology (that is, a theory of knowledge). The Stoics considered these other aspects of their philosophy important because they fed into and informed their main concern: how to live one’s life. The idea was that in order to decide on the best approach to living we also need to understand the nature of the world (metaphysics), how it works (natural science), and how (imperfectly) we come to understand it (epistemology).

The **Stoics accepted the scientific principle** of universal causality: **everything has a cause**, and **everything in the universe unfolds according to natural processes**.

They also **believed that the universe is structured according to what they called the Logos**, which can be interpreted as either **God** or simply what is sometimes termed “**Einstein’s god**”: the **simple, indubitable fact that Nature is understandable by reason**.
