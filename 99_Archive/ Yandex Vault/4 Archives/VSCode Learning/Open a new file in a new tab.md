# Open a new file in a new tab

By default in vs code when you open a file it opens in a preview mode and then when you open another file the existing file gets replaced by the new file that you open. Only after you double click on a file it comes out of preview mode and stays permanently open in your editor until you close it. Personally i find this counter productive. i want all my files to open and be side by side to each other . Again to achieve this its a simple toggle in vs code.

- Go to _settings_.
- Click on _Workbench_.
- Click on _Editor Management_.
- Scroll down and _untick the enable preview option_
- Thats it . Now see the magic happen.
