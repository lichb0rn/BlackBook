By default you can toggle the terminal in vs code using the `ctrl + ~` operation and now a tiny terminal appears at the bottom of your code editor.

Its always nice to have your code and terminal accessible in the same screen but this again eats up your editor space. You can overcome this by dragging the terminal to the top of your workspace where the other file tabs exist and voila you have a _full screen terminal_ right into vs code along with all other file tabs and full screen space as well.
