# [[Эволюция]]

[[Charles Darwin]], who in 1859 published [[On the Origin of Species]]. He and his colleague Alfred Russel Wallace independently amassed a great deal of empirical evidence to buttress two revolutionary insights: first, that **all species on earth are related by common descent**, like people in a family tree, with brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles, and grandparents, reaching all the way back to the origin of life; and second, that the bewildering **variety of living forms on earth**, so exquisitely adapted to their diverse living conditions, **are the result of a fundamental process that they called “natural selection.”** This process—which has been studied and documented in both the field and the laboratory ever since—works according to a remarkably simple algorithm. 

To begin with, Darwin and Wallace noted that natural **populations** of animals and plants **always harbor a degree of variation in the characteristics** of the individuals that make up those populations: some are shorter, some taller; some produce greener leaves, others less so; some are characterized by a fast metabolism, others by a slower one; and so on.  

Second, it is often the case that **distinct variants of any given trait are more or less favorable in the particular environment in which the organism happens to live**. So, for instance, leaves of a certain shape are more suited to life in the desert, where there is plenty of light but little water, while differently shaped leaves are better adapted to life on the floor of the rain forest, where water is abundant but light is scarce. In other words, these characteristics affect the **two things that really matter**—biologically speaking—for any living being on the planet: its **survival** and, even more crucially, its **ability to reproduce**. Finally, there is a correlation between the characteristics of parents and their offspring, because some traits are passed from generation to generation. (Darwin didn’t know how this occurred, though the basic principle had been discovered at about the same time by Gregor Mendel, whose work was not appreciated until 1900.)
