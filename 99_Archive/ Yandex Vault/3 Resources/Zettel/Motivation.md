# [[Motivation]]

Today, **willpower** is compared to muscles: **a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover.** **Improvement** through training **is possible** to a certain degree, but takes time and effort. 

The phenomenon is usually discussed under the term “**ego depletion**”: “We use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reduction in the self’s capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (including controlling the environment, controlling the self, making choices,  and initiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.

One of the most interesting findings of the research on ego depletion is the broad
variety of things that can have a depleting effect.

>Our results suggest that a **broad assortment of actions make use of the same resource**. **Acts of self-control,** responsible decision making, **and active choice** **seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after.** The implication is that some vital resource of the self becomes depleted by such acts of volition. To be sure, we assume that this resource is commonly replenished, although the factors that might hasten or delay the replenishment remain unknown, along with the precise nature of this resource. 
>(Baumeister et al., 1998, 1263f)”

**Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a
way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along.**

It is safe to argue that **a reliable and standardized working environment is less taxing** on our attention, concentration and willpower, or, if you like, ego. It is well known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks, which is why people like [[Barack Obama]] or [[Bill Gates]] only wear two suit colors: dark blue or dark grey.

**Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning.** **They allow the brain to process information, move it into long-term memory and prepare it for new information** (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 69). If we don’t give ourselves a break in between work sessions, be it out of eagerness or fear of forgetting what we were doing, it can have a detrimental effect on our efforts. **To have a walk** (Ratey, 2008) or even **a nap** supports learning and thinking.
