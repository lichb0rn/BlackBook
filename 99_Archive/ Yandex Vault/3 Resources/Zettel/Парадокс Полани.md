In a 1966 book, the British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi made an observation that has since become known as “Polanyi’s Paradox.” It can be summarized as “**We know more than we can say**.”

Polanyi observed that there are **many tasks we can easily perform** as humans that **we can’t fully explain**. For example, driving a car or recognizing a face. We can try to describe how we do these things, but our explanations always fall far short. That’s because we are relying on tacit knowledge, which is impossible to describe in exact detail. We possess that knowledge, but it resides in our subconscious and muscle memory where language cannot reach.

This problem—known as “self-ignorance”—has been a major roadblock in the development of [[Искусственный интеллект|artificial intelligence]] and other computer systems. Because we cannot describe how we know **what we know**, it **can’t be programmed** into software.
