# [[Кратковременная память]]

[[Flow State|Attention]] is not our only limited resource. Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. 

When it came to short-term memory: **We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two.**

Information cannot be saved in short-term memory like on a memory stick. Rather, it kind of
floats around in our heads, seeks our attention and occupies valuable mental resources until it is either forgotten, replaced by something more important (according to our brains) or moved into long-term memory.

It is **so much easier to remember things we understand** than things we don’t.
**Things we understand are connected**, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the [[The Zettelkasten Method|slip-box]] is all about. 

Every step is accompanied by questions like: How does this fact fit into my idea of …? 
How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn’t this argument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before? **What does x mean for y?**
