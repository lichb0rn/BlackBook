# [[Metabolism]]

## Fast and slow metabolism

Even after controlling for factors that influence BMR (like body composition, weight, height, age, and sex), and even without considering outliers, or people with metabolic disorders that considerably increase or decrease BMR, human BMRs cover a pretty wide range.

When you use an equation to estimate your BMR, you can use this handy heuristic: There’s a 68% chance that your actual BMR is within 200 calories of the estimate provided, and a 95% chance that your actual BMR is within 400 calories of the estimate provided. So, if a BMR equation predicts that you have a BMR of 1500 calories per day, there’s a 68% chance that your actual BMR is between 1300 and 1700 calories per day, and a 95% chance that it’s between 1100 and 1900 calories per day.

More concretely, this variability means that two people of the same height, weight, age, sex, body composition, and lifestyle could have energy needs that differ by at least 800 calories per day.

Finally, it’s time to retire the idea that BMRs don’t actually vary much between individuals when controlling for factors like height, weight, age, sex, and body composition. In a very real sense, some people do actually have “fast metabolisms” or “slow metabolisms,” independent of their general demographic and anthropometric characteristics. It might be rhetorically expedient to pretend like those differences don’t exist, but the research demonstrates otherwise.
