There’s scientific evidence that **our intuition knows what it’s doing**.

From the book Designing for Behavior Change:

Participants in a famous study were given four biased decks of cards— some that would win them money, and some that would cause them to lose.

When they started the game, **they didn’t know that the decks were biased**. As they played the game, though, people’s **bodies started showing signs of physical “stress”** when their **conscious minds were about to use a money-losing deck**. The stress was an **automatic response** that occurred because the intuitive mind realized **something was wrong**—long before the conscious mind realized anything was amiss.

The authors’ conclusion: “**Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness.**”
