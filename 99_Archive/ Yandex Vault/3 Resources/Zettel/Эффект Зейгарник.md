# [[Эффект Зейгарник]]

[[Bluma Zeigarnik|Zeigarnik]] effect: **Open tasks tend to occupy our [[Кратковременная память|short-term memory]] – until they are done.** **That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks**, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research, we also know that **we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them.** **All we have to do is to write them down** in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of.

The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. This is why [[David Allen]]’s “[[Getting Things Done]]” system works: **The secret to have a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory.**

The only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all
our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost.

Conversely, **we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind.** 

Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way. While we have a walk or a shower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across. And that is why we so often find the answer to a question in rather casual situations.
