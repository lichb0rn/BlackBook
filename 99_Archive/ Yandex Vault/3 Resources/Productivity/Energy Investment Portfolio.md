The idea of the ‘energy investment portfolio’ is simple. You simply come up with two lists. 
- List A is a list of all your dreams, hopes and ambitions. 
	- These are things you would like to do at some point, just probably not right now. 
- List B is a list of your active investments. 
	- These are the projects you’re actively investing energy into right now (or want to be). And by right now, I mean this week.

The **active investments list should be limited** based on how much time and energy you’ve got to invest in them. This will differ from person to person. I like to limit mine to around five but if you’ve got young kids or a hectic career, you might be ok with three active investments
