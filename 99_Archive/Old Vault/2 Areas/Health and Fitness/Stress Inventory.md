# [[Stress Inventory]]

On top of containing the accomplishment mindset within your productivity hours, it’s worth writing down a list of stresses you face in your life—whether those sources of [[Стресс|stress]] are chronic or acute.

Here’s the challenge: take out a sheet of paper, and list everything in your life that is stressing you out. Do not leave anything out. 

Think through your entire day: look through your morning routine to your work (which may be worth dedicating an entire separate page to) and your responsibilities in your personal life. 

Don’t worry about which sources are chronic or acute, large or small; which stressors you should probably just suck up; which ones you’ve been meaning to deal with.

Remember also to broaden your definition of stress, and include many of the distractions you tend to that serve as small but hidden sources of stress.

Once you’ve captured the stressors you face, sort everything into a sheet with two columns on it: one for the sources of stress you can prevent, the other for ones you cannot. Before you do this step, a word of warning: your sources of unpreventable stress will likely outnumber what’s preventable. That’s normal and to be expected.
