# [[Layout shift]]

When an element is added to the page or its size is changed, everything after the element moves to make room for the element or fill the void left behind. The movement of elements on the page is referred to as a layout shift.

When the image has a set height and width or has a defined aspect ratio, the browser can save room for the image while it’s being loaded, therefore reducing the layout shift. Accordingly, it’s good practice to define aspect ratios and/or height and width for our images.
