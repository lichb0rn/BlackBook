# The Hemingway Bridge

Instead of **burning through every last ounce of energy** at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:

- Write down **ideas for next steps**: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.
- Write down the **current status**: This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future **roadblocks you expect**.
- Write down any **details you have in mind** that are likely to be forgotten once you step away: Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle **considerations of the product** you’re designing.
- Write out your **intention for the next** work session: Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach.
