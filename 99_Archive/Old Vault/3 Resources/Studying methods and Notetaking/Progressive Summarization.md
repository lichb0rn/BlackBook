Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to **distill notes down to their most important points**. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you’ve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project.

The technique is simple: you **highlight the main points** of a note, and then **highlight the main points of those highlights**, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.
