# [[Заметки от руки vs печатные]]

In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014).

They were **not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember**. But **in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better**. **After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearly measurable**.
