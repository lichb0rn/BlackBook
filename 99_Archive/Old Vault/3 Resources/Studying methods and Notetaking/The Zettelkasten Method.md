The Zettelkasten Method is an organic and non-linear, even living, approach on note-taking.

Let us begin with the most important traits of a Zettelkasten:

- It’s hyper-textual.
- It adheres to the Principle of Atomicity.
- It is personal.

## Hypertext

First, it is some kind of hypertext, not a single text or just a collection of texts, but **texts that refer to each other**, explain, expand and use each other’s information. The difference between regular note-taking systems and a Zettelkasten is the emphasis on **forming relationships**. A Zettelkasten makes **connecting** and not collecting a **priority**.

To become a hypertext, a Zettelkasten requires multiple texts, or notes, that you can connect via hyperlinks. We call an individual note a Zettel. Each Zettel needs a unique address by which we can refer to it, to make connections between Zettels.

## Atomicity

Second, a Zettelkasten needs to adhere to the **Principle of Atomicity**. That means that each Zettel only **contains one unit of knowledge** and one only The Zettelkasten is a tool for thought, thus it needs to treat individual thoughts as its base unit.

## Personal

Third, there is one Zettelkasten per person, and one person per Zettelkasten
