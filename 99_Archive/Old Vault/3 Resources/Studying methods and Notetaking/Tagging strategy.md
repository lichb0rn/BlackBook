# Tagging

I propose an entirely different use for tags for modern knowledge work: to **track the progress** of your notes. 

Following the same principle of actionability we’ve used as a north star throughout Building a Second Brain, we can shift the purpose of tags from classification to action and unlock profound benefits to both our productivity and creativity.

There are three practical approaches to tagging you can use as your Second Brain grows and matures. Each one follows the principle of actionability and answers an important question about the purpose of a given note:

1.  Create personalized tags for your use cases. (**How will my notes be used?**)
2.  Use tags to track the progress of notes. (**How are my notes currently being used?**)
3.  Tag notes retroactively and only as needed. (**How have my notes been used?**)

  
## Create personalized tags for your use cases.

Ask yourself, “**What are the most common use cases for the content I capture?**” 
Here are a couple common examples:

• Tagging according to the final product a note will be used in: [Presentation], [Essay], [Report], [Website], [Project plan], [Meeting agenda], or [Budget]

• Tagging according to the kind of information a note contains: [Arguments], [Theories], [Frameworks], [Evidence], [Claim], [Counterpoint], or [Question]
 

## Use tags to track the progress of notes.

Here are a couple examples of how I’ve seen people successfully use tags to track the progress of their notes:

• Tagging according to its role in a project: [Meeting notes], [Timeline], [Budget], [Decision], [Action], [Idea], or [Objective]

• Tagging according to the current stage of their workflow: [Planned], [In process], [Waiting for approval], [Reviewed], [Approved], [On hold], or [Finished]

These kinds of tags aren’t about the contents of a note. They are about its context – specifically, the context in which it is being used. Since information about the current status of a note isn’t usually contained within the note itself, it can be worth adding it in the form of tags.
