# [[Typographic Scale]]

A typographic scale is almost like a musical scale. It uses fonts that work harmoniously with each other and complement each other’s attributes.

Just as harmonics do, text styles in a typographic scale grow and shrink in a certain pattern to produce a set of styles that work well with one other.

The first step in building a typographic scale is to determine a base text style to start from. This text style represents the styling of the body text. Think of the body text as the text that goes inside a paragraph tag on the web.

Once you have the base text style, you scale up or down, depending on your use case, using a scale factor to produce variations.
