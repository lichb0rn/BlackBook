## ℹ️ About

**Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus** ([/ˈnɪəroʊ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_NEER-oh_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); born **Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus**; 15 December AD 37 – 9 June AD 68), was the fifth [Roman emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor "Roman emperor") and final emperor of the [Julio-Claudian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty "Julio-Claudian dynasty"), reigning from AD 54 until his death in AD 68. He was [adopted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_in_Ancient_Rome "Adoption in Ancient Rome") by the Roman emperor [Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius "Claudius") at the age of 13 and succeeded him on the throne. Nero was popular with the members of his [Praetorian Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praetorian_Guard "Praetorian Guard") and lower-class commoners in Rome and its provinces, but he was deeply resented by the Roman aristocracy. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. After being declared a public enemy by the [Roman Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate "Roman Senate"), he committed suicide at age 30.
