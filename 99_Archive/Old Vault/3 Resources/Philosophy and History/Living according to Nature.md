# [[Living according to Nature]]

From [[Aristotle]]’s insight that we are by nature both social and reasoning, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] derived the notion that human life is about the application of reason to social living. The difference between Aristotle and the Stoics may seem subtle, but it is crucial: **Aristotle thought that contemplation is the highest purpose of human life, because our unique function in the animal world is our ability to think.** As you might imagine, this purpose might make for a rather insular existence, so the Stoics shifted the emphasis very much toward the social, essentially arguing that the point of life for human beings is to use reason to build the best society that it is humanly possible to build.

We are now in a much better position to more accurately parse [[Epictetus]]’s response to the questions with which we began this chapter: “For what is Man? A rational animal, subject to death. At once we ask, from what does the rational element distinguish us? From wild beasts. And from what else? From sheep and the like.” His explanation to me continued: “See that you do not act like a sheep, or else again the Man in you perishes. You ask how we act like sheep? When we consult the belly, or our passions, when our actions are random or dirty or inconsiderate, are we not falling away to the state of sheep? What do we destroy? The faculty of reason. When our actions are combative, mischievous, angry, and rude, do we not fall away and become wild beasts?

Epictetus is affirming that what distinguishes humankind from all other species is our capacity for rationality and arguing for an ethical precept as a result: we ought not to behave like beasts or sheep because doing so negates our very humanity, presumably the most precious (and natural!) thing we have.
