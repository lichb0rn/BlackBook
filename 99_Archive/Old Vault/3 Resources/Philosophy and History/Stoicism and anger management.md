>[!quote] [[Эпиктет]]
>Yesterday I had an iron lamp beside my household gods, and hearing a noise I rushed to the window. I found the lamp had been carried off. I reasoned with myself, that the man who took it yielded to some plausible feeling. What do I conclude? Tomorrow, I say, you will find one of earthenware. I lost my lamp, because in the matter of vigilance the thief was a stronger man than I. But he bought his lamp for this price: for a lamp he became a thief, for a lamp he broke his faith, for a lamp he became a brute.

There are correspondences in Christianity (hate the sin, not the sinner), and according to modern psychological research, recasting a situation is a crucial component of anger and emotional management.

If we understand the ancient Greek concept of amathia, we know that it is more helpful to think of people who do bad things as mistaken and therefore to be pitied and helped if possible, not condemned as evil.

It is rather instructive to look at the advice of the American Psychological Association for people dealing with anger and frustration, because it very closely resembles the early intuitions of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]—strengthened, of course, by a significant amount of systematic empirical findings. To begin with, the **APA counsels engaging in a series of relaxation techniques**. These include **deep breathing** (from the diaphragm, not the chest), coupled with a simple and meaningful **mantra**. You can also use imagery—**visualizing**, for instance, a calming or pleasant situation—and engage in some sort of **non-strenuous exercise**, like yoga stretching.

Although the Stoics didn’t deploy the concept of mantra, they constantly advised practitioners to keep simple, pithy phrases at hand and to reach for them as soon as they saw trouble. Indeed, the entire **[[Enchiridion]]**, Arrian’s summary of [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]]’s Discourses, can be considered a handy set of quick reminders of crucial points for use on the spur of the moment. And **Seneca explicitly advised taking a deep breath and going for a walk around** the block upon first feeling the uncontrollable rise of rage, which he considered a type of temporary madness. He also said, in his letters to his friend Lucilius, that it is good to exercise regularly, even in old age, not just because exercise keeps the body in decent shape, but because it has a calming effect on the mind.

Mantra: **bear and forbear**, which is a standard Epictetian phrase.

This advice, a sort of physiological and mental first-aid kit, is useful for immediate crises, but a **number of longer-term strategies must also be deployed if anger is to be effectively managed**, according to the APA. One set of strategies involves **cognitive restructuring**, of which we have seen plenty of Stoic examples, including the ones just discussed. The APA tells us to **change standard phrases like “this is terrible!”** to something along the lines of **“I’d rather not have to deal with this, but I can manage it, and getting angry isn’t going to help me at all.”** Moreover, the suggestion is to **transform demands into desires**, in recognition that the world isn’t just going to bow down to whatever we like.

This is very similar to the modern Stoic idea, proposed by [[Bill Irvine]], of learning to internalize goals: I desire (not want or need) a promotion, so I’m going to do my best to deserve it. Whether I actually get it or not is not under my control, because it depends on a number of factors external to my will. As an APA article on anger management—which could easily have been written by [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]]—reminds us: “**Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it’s justified, can quickly become irrational. So use cold hard logic on yourself**.

Next, the APA advises us to **engage in problem-solving** (rather than complaining), but warns us against a common fallacy: **we need to realize that**—contra common cultural belief—**it just isn’t the case that every problem has a solution**. We therefore need to cut ourselves some slack for not being able to solve everything, so long as we have done all we can reasonably do under the circumstances. Don’t focus on just finding a solution, the APA advises, but on how to handle the entire situation.

Another crucial way of handling anger is classified by the APA as “**better communication**,” specifically better communication with people who make you angry. Interestingly, a large component of this advice relies again on Stoic precepts: **we should try to describe the situation making us angry as dispassionately and accurately as possible**, what Epictetus called giving assent to (or withdrawing assent from) our impressions.

The APA also counsels **humor as an antidote to anger**, and we have seen this deployed both by ancient Stoics like Epictetus.

However, the APA also rightly recommends using humor judiciously: we should neither simply laugh off our problems (or, worse, other people’s) nor cross the fuzzy line between humor and sarcasm. Sarcasm, an aggressive and belittling type of response, is rarely useful, and certainly not in those situations that involve conflict and anger.

Additional suggestions from professional psychologists include **changing your environment**, for instance, by taking a physical break from the problematic situation; shifting the timing of your interaction with another person if the present moment seems not to be the best time to handle the problem, but being sure to set an alternative time for coming back to it in order to send the signal that you are not dodging it.
