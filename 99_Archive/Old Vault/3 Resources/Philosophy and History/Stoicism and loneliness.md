# [[Stoicism and loneliness]]

A paper published by [[Colin Killeen]] in the Journal of Advanced Nursing offers an interesting discussion of loneliness from a modern, scientific perspective. To begin with, Killeen **distinguishes** loneliness from similar, yet separate, **related concepts**, such as **alienation** (which may be the result, or in some cases the cause, of depression) and **solitude**?

The paper presents a classification of what Killeen calls the “alienation-connectedness continuum” from negative to positive—alienation <> loneliness <> social isolation <> aloneness <> solitude <> connectedness—with society’s perspective ranging from negative at the alienation extreme to positive at the connectedness one. The author superimposes on this continuum what he calls a “**choice continuum**”—**from no choice (alienation, loneliness)** at one extreme to **total choice (solitude, connectedness)** at the other.

The Killeen paper provides a handy summary diagram identifying a series of causes related to our situations and our characters that lead to loneliness, including bereavement, psychological vulnerability, reduced social network, depression, and radical life changes. These are accompanied by a number of associated factors, including age, gender, and health.

The bottom line, in Killeen’s view, is that there is no “solution” to the problem of loneliness, because it is highly multifactorial and because it depends on both personal (psychological, situational) and structural (societal) factors.

The author’s surprisingly sober yet refreshingly honest commentary: “[Loneliness] is such an innate part of the human psyche, that it **cannot be solved like a puzzle; it can only be alleviated and made less painful**. This can only be achieved by increasing humankind’s awareness of this distressing condition that everyone has to endure in some way, shape or form, sometime during their lives, about which there is nothing to be embarrassed.

One distinction between loneliness and being alone would have been perfectly clear to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]: the latter is a factual description, while the former is a judgment we superimpose on that description, and it is that judgment, not the naked fact, that makes us feel rejected and powerless. Importantly, however, there is a positive message in [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]]’s words, which can seem rather stern at first glance: **the other side of endurance is resilience, and resilience is empowering**. We may have little or no control over the external circumstances that force us into being alone at some times in our lives. But (save for pathological conditions, for which one needs to seek medical help), it is our choice, our own attitude, that turns solitude into loneliness. **We may be alone, but we do not consequently need to feel helpless.**
