# [[Nonprediction]]

It is far easier to figure out **if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it**. Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurable. This provides a solution to what I’ve called the [[Black Swan problem]]—**the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events and predicting their occurrence**.
