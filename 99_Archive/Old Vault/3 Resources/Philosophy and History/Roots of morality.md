# [[Roots of morality]]

In modern discussions of the roots of morality, there are, roughly speaking, four ways to look at the issue, or what philosophers refer to as “meta-ethical” positions: one can be a skeptic, a rationalist, an empiricist, or an intuitionist.

If you are a **[[Skepticism|skeptic]]** in this context, you are basically saying that there is no way to know which ethical judgments are right or not. Often moral skeptics claim that when people say, for instance, that “murder is wrong,” they are committing a special kind of error (known as a **category mistake**): mixing up things that don’t belong to each other, like a statement of fact (a murder was committed) and a value judgment (something is wrong).

**[[Rationalism]]** is a general position in philosophy that maintains that it is possible to arrive at knowledge by just thinking about stuff, as opposed to observing or experimenting. Although this plays into the stereotype of the so-called armchair philosopher, don’t laugh too quickly: logicians and mathematicians produce new knowledge by rationalist means all the time, so the question really is whether ethics is anything like mathematics or logic.

Often counterposed against rationalism is **[[Empiricism|empiricism]]**, the stance that we ultimately arrive at knowledge on the basis of empirical facts—that is, observations and experiments. Science is the ultimate empiricist discipline of course, so to say that ethical knowledge can be arrived at empirically is to attempt to somehow bridge the is/ought gap in a scientifically based way.

Finally, we have **[[Intuitionism|intuitionism]]**, the proposition that ethical knowledge does not require any kind of inference, whether by way of reason or observation. Instead, it is sort of built into us in the form of strong intuitions about what is right and wrong.

The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] approach to ethics is interesting because it doesn’t actually fit these four neat categories. Indeed, **Stoic doctrine can be thought of as a combination of intuitionism, empiricism, and rationalism.** The Stoics, however, were most definitely not skeptics.
