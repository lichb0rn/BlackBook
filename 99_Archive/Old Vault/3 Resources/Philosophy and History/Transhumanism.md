# [[Transhumanism]]

A number of techno-optimists **think that death is a disease that should be cured**, and they are investing good money in the effort. Broadly speaking, they call themselves “Transhumanists,” and quite a few of them can be found among the white male millionaires in Silicon Valley, where many of the world’s most influential tech companies are located. Perhaps the most famous and influential of the bunch is [[Ray Kurzweil]], a futurist (someone who thinks he can study and predict the future) currently working at [[Google]] to develop a software capable of understanding natural language.

Kurzweil has a number of important achievements under his belt, including the development of the first omni-font optical character recognition system. Age sixty-eight at the time of this writing, he has been arguing for some time that the way to immortality will be to upload our consciousness into a computer, which he claims will be possible any day now. Indeed, we better manage that feat before the so-called [[Singularity]], a term invented by the mathematician [[Stanisław Ulam]] to describe **the moment when computers will outsmart people and begin to drive technological progress independently**—and perhaps even in spite—of humanity itself.
