# [[Stoic Framework]]

The framework is the idea that **in order to live a good** (in the sense of eudaemonic) **life**, one **has to understand two things: the nature of the world** (and by extension, one’s place in it) **and the nature of human reasoning** (including when it fails, as it so often does). An ancient student of Stoicism would probably have pursued these goals by studying physics, logic, and ethics.

## Stoic disciplines

These are often referred to as the three **Stoic disciplines**: **desire**, **action**, and **assent**. They are directly related to the three areas of study—as well as to the four virtues (discussed in detail later)—in this way:

The **discipline of desire** (also referred to as **Stoic acceptance**) tells us **what is and is not proper to want**. This, in turn, derives from the fact that some things are in our power and others are not. We can appreciate that crucial difference from an understanding of how the world works, as only people who are not schooled in physics make the mistake of thinking that they control more than they actually do (that is, they engage in wishful thinking).

Two of the four **Stoic virtues** are pertinent to regulating desire: **courage** (to face facts and act accordingly) and **temperance** (to rein in our desires and make them commensurate with what is achievable). 

The **discipline of action** (known also as **Stoic philanthropy**, in the sense of concern for others) **tells us how to behave in the world**. It is the result of a proper understanding of ethics, the study of how to live our lives, and it draws on the virtue of justice. 

Finally, the **discipline of assent** (or [[Stoic mindfulness]]) tells us **how to react to situations**, in the sense of either giving our assent to our initial impressions of a situation or withdrawing it. This discipline is arrived at via the study of logic—what is and is not reasonable to think—and requires the virtue of practical wisdom.
