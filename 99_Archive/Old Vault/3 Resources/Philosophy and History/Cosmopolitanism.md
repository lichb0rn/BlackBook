# [[Cosmopolitanism]]

[[Epictetus]] was telling that a **fundamental aspect of being human is that we are social**, not just in the sense that we like the company of others, but in the deeper sense that we couldn’t really exist without the help of others; the implication is that when we do things for the good of the polity, we are actually (perhaps indirectly) benefiting ourselves.

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] perfected this idea of ethical development and called it oikeiôsis, which is often translated as “familiarization with” or “appropriation of” other people’s concerns as if they were our own. This led them (and the [[Cynics]] who immediately preceded them and influenced them greatly) to coin and use a word that is still crucial to our modern vocabulary: **cosmopolitanism**, which literally **means “being a citizen of the world.”** Or as [[Socrates]]—arguably the most important influence on all Hellenistic schools of philosophy—put it: **“Never… reply to one who asks your country, ‘I am an Athenian,’ or ‘I am a Corinthian,’ but ‘I am a citizen of the universe.’**
