# [[Stoicism and anxiety]]

Why are we so anxious about all sorts of things? “When I see a man in a state of anxiety, I say, ‘What can this man want? If he did not want something which is not in his power, how could he still be anxious? It is for this reason that one who sings to the lyre is not anxious when he is performing by himself, but when he enters the theatre, even if he has a very good voice and plays well: for he not only wants to perform well, but also to win a great name, and that is beyond his own control.’” This is yet another version of [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]]’s cardinal idea of the [[Dichotomy of Control|dichotomy of control]].

That is why it is peculiar that **people tend to pay attention to, and be worried by, exactly the wrong sort of things**. [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] explained it to this way: “We are anxious for our bit of a body, for our bit of property, for what Caesar will think, but are not anxious at all for what is within us. Am I anxious about not conceiving a false thought? No, for that depends on myself. Or about indulging an impulse contrary to nature? No, not about this either.”

[[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] is addressing the long-term course of our lives rather than whatever immediate problem we may face. **We tend to adopt upside-down priorities, to be worried about things that are ultimately less important and definitely less under our control than what we should really be worried about and focusing energy and time on**.
