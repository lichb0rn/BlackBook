# [[Setting Widths and Heights]]

•	 To set the width and height of an element in [[064 HTML and CSS|css]], use the styles
```css
width: value;
height: value;
```
where value is the width or height in one of the CSS units of measurement or a
percentage of the width or height of the parent element.

•	 To set the minimum possible width or height, use the styles
```css
min-width: value;
min-height: value;
```

•	 To set the maximum possible width or height, use the styles
```css
max-width: value;
max-height: value;
```

>[!note]
>Studies have shown that lines of text that are too wide are difficult to read because the eye has to scan across a long section of content and that lines of text that are too narrow with too many line returns, break the flow of the material.
