# [[How to Conquer Desire]]

Modern English isn’t well equipped to capture some of the distinctions made in ancient Greek philosophy, especially when it comes to describing emotions and sensations. We use the word “pleasure” very broadly to encompass almost any positive feeling. However, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] distinguished between the **sort of pleasure (hedone) we get from “external” things like food** or sex or flattery and the **deeper sense of inner joy (chara)** that [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] is talking about. Stoic joy is profound. It comes from achieving your fundamental goal in life and experiencing genuine fulfillment, which make ordinary pleasures seem trivial by comparison.

The Stoics refer to it as the pure form of “joy” that someone experiences who is living a truly great life and has attained genuine personal fulfillment (**eudaimonia**).  

There are two more key points about Stoic joy worth emphasizing:

1. The Stoics tended to view joy not as the goal of life, which is wisdom, but as a by-product of it, so they believed that trying to pursue it directly might lead us down the wrong path if it’s sought at the expense of wisdom.

2. Joy in the Stoic sense is fundamentally active rather than passive; it comes from perceiving the virtuous quality of our own deeds, the things we do, whereas bodily pleasures arise from experiences that happen to us, even if they’re a consequence of actions like eating, drinking, or having sex.
  

The Greek word for joy (chara) is closely related to that for gratitude (charis). Indeed, the Stoics encourage you **to appreciate the external things Fortune has given you**. Marcus cautions, however, that **you must exercise moderation in this regard**. You should **not fall into the habit of overvaluing external things and becoming overly attached to them**. You can check this, he says, by asking yourself whether you would be upset if the things you value were ever taken away.

## STEPS FOR CHANGING DESIRES

You should carefully evaluate your habits and desires in terms of the bigger picture: **how much do these pursuits actually contribute to your long-term happiness or sense of fulfillment in life?**

A simple framework for evaluating and changing your behavior based on a combination of [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive therapy]] and ancient Stoic practices. It consists of the following steps:

1. Evaluate the consequences of your habits or desires in order to select which ones to change.
2. Spot early warning signs so that you can nip problematic desires in the bud.
3. Gain cognitive distance by separating your impressions from external reality.
4. **Do something else instead of engaging in the habit.**

In addition, consider how you might introduce other sources of healthy positive feelings by:  

1. Planning new activities that are consistent with your core values.
2. Contemplating the qualities you admire in other people.
3. Practicing gratitude for the things you already have in life.


### EVALUATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF DESIRES

How do you identify which habits to change? Modern therapists often help their clients weigh the pros and cons of different courses of action in order to choose among them. Sometimes this is called a “cost-benefit analysis” or “functional analysis.

For instance, **if you regularly watch television for an hour after work, what are the long-term pros and cons of that habit? What could you do instead that would be more consistent with your true values in life, and how would that work out in the long run?** Some philosophers, as we’ve seen, claim that the mere act of exercising moderation could become more gratifying itself than indulging in bad habits.

Remember, the **purpose of this exercise is not just to reduce bad habits but to introduce more activities** that are intrinsically valued and rewarding, like the Stoic virtues.

You may find it also helps to picture the positive consequences of refraining from the desire, mastering it, or doing the opposite of it. It can be helpful to visualize two paths ahead of you, just like the fork in the road that confronted Hercules: for example, quitting smoking versus continuing, exercising versus doing nothing. Spend time picturing how these two paths would grow apart over time, where they might lead you several months or even years from now.

### SPOT EARLY WARNING SIGNS

Now that you’ve considered what sort of habits or desires might conflict with your values and be worth changing, your next step is to “catch them in the wild” by noticing when they’re actually happening.

When done properly, this sort of self-monitoring is effectively a form of training in Stoic mindfulness.

**Keep a written daily record of the situations in which you notice the desire emerging.** This can be as simple as tallying each time you sense even the slightest inclination to engage in the habit, the first inkling of the desire. It could also be a more detailed record sheet, including rows with columns for the date/time, the external situation (“**Where were you?”**), the early warning signs you notice, and/or a rating from zero to ten of the strength of the urge and possibly also the level of actual pleasure you experienced if you gave in to it. If you find it helpful, you might also want to record any thoughts you had that facilitated or excused the desire, such as “Just this once won’t hurt!” or “I can always stop tomorrow,” or “I just don’t have the willpower.

### GAIN COGNITIVE DISTANCE

Once you’ve spotted the early warning signs of a craving or habit, you can also help yourself change by **noticing the separation between your current perspective and external reality**. 

We’ve already introduced the concept of [[Cognitive distancing|cognitive distancing]] from modern psychotherapy. It provides a way of understanding one of the most important psychological practices in [[Stoicism]]: that of **“separating” our values from external events**.

When a desire or habit emerges, you can take note of thoughts that encourage it—“I wonder what’s happening online”—and also thoughts or excuses that facilitate it—“It won’t hurt if I just check my social media messages for a second.” Observing these in a detached way, almost as if they were someone else’s thoughts, will help you gain cognitive distance and will weaken the urge to act on them.

There are many different ways of gaining cognitive distance. One is to imagine how a role model might perceive the same situation differently.

We may as well borrow the term used by the early twentieth-century psychotherapist [[Charles Baudouin,]] who was influenced by [[Stoicism]], to describe this psychological technique: “**depreciation by analysis**. That means **breaking any problem down into small chunks that seem less emotionally powerful or overwhelming**.

Someone compulsively checking social media might stop and ask if not reading each individual notification would really be so unbearable. If you practice self-awareness in this way, you’ll often (but not always) realize that the pleasure you obtain from such habits is actually much less than you previously assumed.

**People often talk about the things they crave in language that’s bound to excite their own desire**, even when they realize they are fostering unhealthy habits: “**I’m dying for some chocolate. Why is it so good? It tastes like heaven!** This is better than sex.” (It’s mainly vegetable fat, some cacao, and a load of refined sugar.) That’s another example of rhetoric working against you. On the other hand, when you describe food, or anything else you crave, in down-to-earth language, you can feel detached from it.

### DO SOMETHING ELSE
You’ve identified which desires you want to overcome, learned how to spot their early warning signs, and practiced how to pause and gain distance from them. In a sense, **the best thing to do next is nothing.**
