# [[First Principles Thinking]]

First principles thinking is one of the best ways to reverse-engineer complicated situations and unleash creative possibility. Sometimes called reasoning from first principles, it’s a tool to help clarify complicated problems by separating the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. What remain are the essentials.

The idea of building knowledge from first principles has a long tradition in philosophy. In the Western canon it goes back to [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]], with significant contributions from [[Aristotle]] and [[Descartes]]. Essentially, they were looking for the foundational knowledge that would not change and that we could build everything else on, from our ethical systems to our social structures.


When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoin. So is love. The list goes on.

If we want to identify the principles in a situation to cut through the dogma and the shared belief, there are two techniques we can use: [[Socratic questioning]] and the Five Whys. 

Socratic questioning can be used to establish first principles through stringent analysis. This is a disciplined questioning process, used to establish truths, reveal underlying assumptions, and separate knowledge from ignorance.


## Socratic questioning

Socratic questioning generally follows this process:

1. Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (**Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?**)
2. Challenging assumptions. (**How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?**)
3. Looking for evidence. (**How can I back this up? What are the sources?**)
4. Considering alternative perspectives. (**What might others think? How do I know I am correct?**)
5. Examining consequences and implications. (**What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?**)
6. Questioning the original questions. (**Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?**)

**Socratic questioning stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses.**

## Five Whys

The goal of the Five Whys is to land on a “what” or “how”. It is about **systematically delving further into a statement** or concept so that you can separate reliable knowledge from assumption. If your “whys” result in a statement of falsifiable fact, you have hit a first principle. If they end up with a “because I said so” or ”it just is”, you know you have landed on an assumption that may be based on popular opinion, cultural myth, or dogma. These are not first principles.
 
Incremental innovation and paradigm shifts.
To improve something, we need to understand why it is successful or not. Otherwise, we are just copying thoughts or behaviors without understanding why they worked. First principles thinking helps us avoid the problem of relying on someone else’s tactics without understanding the rationale behind them. Even incremental improvement is harder to achieve if we can’t identify the first principles.
