# [[Daily Stoic practices]]

When teaching people to employ [[Stoicism|Stoic]] practices, I’ve found it helpful to have a simple framework for daily Stoic practices. It involves **a “learning cycle” with a beginning, middle, and end**, which then repeats each day. 

In the morning you prepare for the day ahead; throughout the day you try to live consistently in accord with your values; and in the evening you review your progress and prepare to repeat the cycle again the next day. I’ll refer to the Stoic exercises used at the beginning and end of each day as the morning and evening meditations.

This framework also fits in neatly with our discussion of modeling and mentoring. During your morning meditation, consider what tasks you have to complete and what challenges you must overcome. Ask yourself, “**What would my role model do?**” and try to imagine them dealing with the same situations you’re about to face. Mentally rehearse the virtues you want to exhibit.

Throughout the day, **try continually to be self-aware, as if a wise mentor or teacher is observing you**. We call this “**[[Stoic mindfulness]]**” today, but the Stoics meant something similar by prosoche, or paying attention to yourself. Keep an eye on how you use your mind and body, particularly the value judgments you make in different situations, and watch out for subtle feelings of anger, fear, sadness, or unhealthy desires, as well as bad habits.

During your evening meditation, **review how things actually went,** perhaps going over the key events of the day two or three times in your mind’s eye. **What would your imaginary mentors say?** What advice might they give you about doing things differently next time? This is your opportunity to learn from experience and prepare for the morning, when you’ll plan your behavior and rehearse things again in an ongoing cycle of self-improvement. You might ask yourself, for example, “**What would Marcus Aurelius say about how I fared today?**"

Regarding the morning meditation, [[Galen]] says that as soon as you rise from bed and begin considering each of the tasks ahead, **you should ask yourself two questions**:

1. What would the consequences be if you acted as a slave to your passions?
2. How would your day differ if you acted more rationally, exhibiting wisdom and self-discipline?

This famous passage from “The Golden Verses,” which [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] quoted to his students, describes the evening meditation:

>[!quote]
>Allow not sleep to close your wearied eyes,
Until you have reckoned up each daytime deed:
“Where did I go wrong? What did I do? And what duty’s left undone?”
From first to last review your acts and then
Reprove yourself for wretched acts, but rejoice in those done well.

  
You can ask yourself these three very simple questions:

1. **What did you do badly?** Did you allow yourself to be ruled by irrational fears or unhealthy desires? Did you act badly or allow yourself to indulge in irrational thoughts?
2. **What did you do well?** Did you make progress by acting wisely? Praise yourself and reinforce what you want to repeat.
3. **What could you do differently?** Did you omit any opportunities to exercise virtue or strength of character? How could you have handled things better?
