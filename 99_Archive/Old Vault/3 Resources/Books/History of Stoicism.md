# [[History of Stoicism]]

## Beginning

As the story is told by Diogenes Laertius in his Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, **Stoicism began in Athens**, Greece, around the year 300 BCE. [[Zeno]], a Phoenician merchant and native of Citium (modern-day Cyprus) who, we are assured, was fond of eating green figs and basking in the sun, **became interested in philosophy after being shipwrecked** on a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus with a cargo of purple. He went up into Athens and sat down in a bookseller’s shop, being then a man of thirty. As he went on reading the second book of Xenophon’s Memorabilia, he was so pleased that he inquired where men like [[Socrates]] were to be found. [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]] (a Cynic philosopher) **passed by in the nick of time**, so the bookseller pointed to him and said, “Follow yonder man.

**Zeno did follow Crates and became his student**. 
One of the first things he learned from his new teacher was **to practice not being ashamed of things of which there is nothing to be ashamed**. Crates had Zeno go around with a potful of lentil soup. Crates then broke the pot, and Zeno took to flight in shame, with his teacher yelling after him, in full view of a crowd: “Why run away, my little Phoenician? Nothing terrible has befallen you.” 

**Zeno studied under Crates and other philosophers for several years, after which he felt confident enough to start his own school.** While initially **his followers were**, predictably enough, **called Zenonians**, **eventually they began to be referred to as “Stoics”**, because they met under the Stoa Poikile, or painted porch, a public place in the center of the city. 

Anyone could come by and listen to **Zeno talk about a number of topics, from human nature to duty, law, education, poetry, rhetoric, and ethics**, among others. (We know this because, although few of Zeno’s writings have survived, the titles of his books are listed by Diogenes Laertius.) Zeno died at a very old age.

**Stoicism didn’t come out of nowhere**, of course. The early Stoics were **heavily influenced by** previous philosophical schools and thinkers, in particular by [[Socrates]] and by the **Cynics**, but also **by the Academics** (followers of [[Plato]]).  

They spent a significant amount of time engaging rivals in lively debate, especially the Academics, the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle), and of course the Epicureans. Epictetus, for instance, devotes three entire chapters of the Discourses to rebutting [[Epicurus]]. Each of these schools was “eudaemonic”—that is, **their objective was to figure out the best way of living a human life**. **Some emphasized virtue (the Peripatetics, the Cynics, and the Stoics)**, and **others pleasure (the Epicureans, the Cyrenaics)** while still **others were more interested in metaphysics (the Academics)** **or in the limits of human knowledge (the Skeptics**). **All, however, aimed at the same goal: a flourishing existence.**


## Crucial point

This went on for a while, until in 155 BCE something very important happened to ancient philosophy: the heads of the Stoa (Diogenes of Babylon), the Academy, and the Peripatetic school were chosen as ambassadors to represent Athens in political negotiations with Rome.

The Athenians’ visit had a great cultural impact, far beyond its diplomatic import: the philosophers gave packed lectures in the capital, shocking the rather conservative Roman establishment and igniting an interest in philosophy among the Romans for the first time.

Then, during the years 88–86 BCE, two philosophers, the Peripatetic Athenion and the Epicurean Aristion, briefly in turn gained absolute power in Athens.

However, they made the strategically fatal mistake of siding with [[King Mithridates]] against the Romans, an alliance that eventually led to the sack of Athens. The episode spelled the end of that venerable city as the philosophical capital of the ancient world, as major exponents of all schools moved to quieter places, including Rhodes, Alexandria, and especially Rome itself. It was a pivotal moment in the history of Western philosophy.  

## Decline

This transitional, second period of Stoic history is referred to as the “middle Stoa.” The **great Roman orator [[Cicero]], who was sympathetic to Stoic ideas**, is one of our major sources for both the early and the middle Stoa.

**By the time [[Emperor Constantine]] legalized Christianity in 312 CE**, Stoicism was in decline, as were a number of other schools of thought. Eventually, the Byzantine emperor Justinian closed the Academy in 529 CE, thus ending the ancient Greco-Roman philosophical tradition altogether. The **idea of Stoicism, however, survived in the writings of the many historical figures** who were influenced by it (including those who were sometimes critical of it), among them some of the **Early Church Fathers, Augustine, Boethius, [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Giordano Bruno]], Thomas More, [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Descartes]], Montesquieu, and [[Baruch Spinoza]]**.

## Rebirth

In the twentieth century, **Stoicism saw a resurgence after the Second World War**, when, as we have seen, it inspired [[Viktor Frankl]]’s **logotherapy**, [[Albert Ellis]]’s rational **emotive behavior therapy, and the broad family of cognitive behavioral therapies**.
