# [[Relativity]]

>[!quote] [[Steven Strogatz]]
>The theory of relativity is founded on empathy. Not empathy in the ordinary emotional sense; empathy in a rigorous scientific sense. The crucial idea is to imagine how things would appear to someone who’s moving in a different way than you are.»

## Galileo's discovery

In the 1630s, [[Galileo]] discovered that any two observers moving at constant speed and direction will obtain the same results for all mechanical experiments they perform.

Galileo’s original thought experiment describes a scientist on a ship moving at constant velocity. The scientist is below deck with no portholes to give him a frame of reference for the movement of the ship. When this scientist drops a ball from waist level, he will notice only the vertical movement caused by gravity. He will observe that the ball drops to the floor of the ship. However, there is also a horizontal movement that the scientist doesn’t perceive. Both the scientist and the ball are also moving the distance covered by the ship as the ball is falling to the ground.

An outside observer, someone standing on a nearby beach or a fish in the water can detect the complete movement of the ball because their perspective is different. By being outside the ship, they see a more complete version of reality.

Right now you probably feel as though you’re stationary. However, if you’re on Earth, you’re moving around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour. Galileo developed this thought experiment partly thanks to his belief that Copernicus was right and that the earth itself is in motion that we do not perceive.

## Einsteins relativity

In the early 1900s, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used another famous thought experiment when developing his theory of special relativity, which linked mass and energy using the formula $E=mc^2$. This formula demonstrates that energy is equivalent to mass times the speed of light squared. With this theory, Einstein stated that the speed of light is fixed within any frame of reference moving at a constant velocity, and therefore there is no fixed frame of reference from which one can measure the physical laws. This is what Galileo had argued, but his ideas were put aside in the 1700s in favor of a view that said that there was an absolute frame of reference. Einstein’s theory of special relativity revived Galileo’s ideas.

Einstein’s thought experiment to describe special relativity illustrated the concept that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This means that two events can happen simultaneously from one observer’s perspective and at different times from another observer’s perspective.

## Relative thinking

**There is an objective reality, but none of us can perceive it in totality** without doing a little work. Is it any wonder we make suboptimal decisions?

When you see someone doing something that doesn’t make sense to you, ask yourself **what the world would have to look like to you for those actions to make sense**.

How other people frame something is their vantage point. It’s not an unobstructed description of reality, but rather their individual perspective. **Making efforts to understand someone’s view helps you understand their frame, their set of beliefs and biases that guide how they see their world.**
