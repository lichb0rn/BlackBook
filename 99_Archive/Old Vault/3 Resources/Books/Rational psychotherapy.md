# [[Rational psychotherapy]]

At the start of the twentieth century, long before [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]], there was another “rational” or “cognitive” approach to psychotherapy that competed with [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychoanalysis but is now largely forgotten. The Swiss psychiatrist and neuropathologist [[Paul Dubois]], author of [[The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment]] (1904), was the main proponent of what became known as “rational psychotherapy.” 

**Dubois believed that psychological problems were due mainly to negative thinking**, which worked like negative autosuggestion, and he favored a treatment based on the practice of “[[Socrates|Socratic]] dialogue” through which he sought to rationally persuade patients to abandon the unhealthy ideas responsible for various neurotic and psychosomatic conditions. The influence of the ancient [[Stoicism|Stoics]] is clear from Dubois’s scattered references to them.

If we eliminate from ancient writings a few allusions that gave them local color, we shall find the ideas of [[Socrates]], [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]], [[Seneca]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]] absolutely modern and applicable to our times.

“One exaggerates, imagines, anticipates affliction,” wrote [[Seneca]]. For a long time, I have told my discouraged patients and have repeated to myself, “**Do not let us build a second story to our sorrow by being sorry for our sorrow.**”
