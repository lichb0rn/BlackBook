# [[Stoic Sage]]

Writing down the [[The four virtues|virtues]] possessed by a hypothetical wise man or woman, or those we aspire to ourselves, is usually a very beneficial exercise. It may also be useful for you to formulate descriptions of two or three specific individuals and compare these to a more general description of an ideal. These could be real acquaintances from your life, historical figures, or even fictional characters. The important thing is to process the information by reflecting on it and revising it where necessary. Allow some time to pass and then come back to review and improve your descriptions. Consider how specific virtues, such as wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation, might be exhibited by role models you’ve chosen.

Psychologists call this “**modeling**” someone’s behavior. We’ve already touched upon it briefly in our discussion of decatastrophizing in [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive therapy]]. You might want to ask yourself, for example, “**What would Marcus do?**”

In addition to visualizing people to model their behavior, we can also model their attitudes. Stoics might ask themselves, “What would [[Socrates]] or [[Zeno]] say about this?” You can imagine your personal role model—or even a whole panel of Stoic Sages—giving you advice.

Modeling is typically followed by the “mental rehearsal” of behavior change: picturing yourself acting more like your role models or imagining yourself following their advice. This often takes several attempts. Think of it as trial-and-error learning.

That’s known as the benefit of “coping imagery” over “mastery imagery.” Don’t try to run before you can walk by setting unrealistic goals.
