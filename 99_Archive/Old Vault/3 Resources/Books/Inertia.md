# [[Inertia]]

In [[Physics|physics]], inertia refers to the resistance a physical object has to a change in its state of motion. **Things at rest don’t start moving on their own**, and planets continue to circle the sun without a means of propulsion. 

The phenomenon of inertia is the subject of [[Isaac Newton]]’s first law of motion, which states, “**An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force**.” If a force—for example, friction—is not present, the object will continue as it was, moving in the same velocity or remaining at rest. Left to themselves, systems resist change.

In his book [[Principles of Philosophy]], [[Descartes]] talks about inertia as well, stating that the first law of nature is that “each thing, as far as is in its power, always remains in the same state; and that consequently, when it is once moved, it always continues to move.”

Inertia is a useful model to try to understand some elements of our behavior, including our thinking patterns and habits. **Our natural inclination to reject the new is in part normal resistance to the effort required to change.** Keeping things as they are requires almost no effort and involves little uncertainty.

Inertia as a lens shows us that beliefs can become habits. Habits are entrenched behaviors, some of which are good, while others are bad.

In Learning from the Octopus, Rafe Sagarin writes that belief systems have an “enormous evolutionary inertia behind them,” explaining that our capacity for belief has been one of our survival mechanisms and that this biological relevance helps explain why beliefs are so resistant to change. Thus, sometimes the inertia of our beliefs hinders us, such as when they make us blind to new opportunities. Or when we dismiss new information or ideas because they don’t fit with what we think we know about the world.
