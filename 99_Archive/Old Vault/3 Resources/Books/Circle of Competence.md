# [[Circle of Competence]]

When ego and not competence drives what we undertake, we have blind spots. If you know what you understand, you know where you have an edge over others. **When you are honest about where your knowledge is lacking you know where you are vulnerable and where you can improve.** Understanding your circle of competence improves decision-making and outcomes.  

How do you know when you have a circle of competence? Within our circles of competence, we know exactly what we don’t know. We are able to make decisions quickly and relatively accurately. We possess detailed knowledge of additional information we might need to make a decision with full understanding, or even what information is unobtainable. We know what is knowable and what is unknowable and can distinguish between the two.

**There is no shortcut to understanding.** Building a circle of competence takes years of experience, of making mistakes, and of actively seeking out better methods of practice and thought.

## How do you build and maintain a circle of competence?

One of the essential requirements of a circle of competence is that you can never take it for granted. You can’t operate as if a circle of competence is a static thing, that once attained is attained for life.

There are three key practices needed in order to build and maintain a circle of competence: curiosity and a desire to learn, monitoring, and feedback.

- First, **you have to be willing to learn.** Learning comes when experience meets reflection. You can learn from your own experiences. Or you can learn from the experience of others, through books, articles, and conversations.

- Second, **you need to monitor your track record in areas which you have, or want to have, a circle of competence.** And you need to have the courage to monitor honestly so the feedback can be used to your advantage. The reason we have such difficulty with overconfidence is because we have a problem with honest self-reporting. We don’t keep the right records, because we don’t really want to know what we’re good and bad at.

**Keeping a [[Performance Journal|journal of your own performance]] is the easiest and most private way to give self-feedback.**  Journals allow you to step out of your automatic thinking and ask yourself: **What went wrong? How could I do better? Monitoring your own performance allows you to see patterns that you simply couldn’t see before.** This type of analysis is painful for the ego, which is also why it helps build a circle of competence. You can’t improve if you don’t know what you’re doing wrong.

- Finally, you must occasionally solicit external feedback. This helps build a circle, but is also critical for maintaining one.

It is extremely difficult to maintain a circle of competence without an outside perspective. We usually have too many biases to solely rely on our own observations. It takes courage to solicit external feedback, so if defensiveness starts to manifest, focus on the result you hope to achieve.

## How do you operate outside a circle of competence?

Part of successfully using circles of competence includes knowing when we are outside them—when we are not well equipped to make decisions.

**There are three parts to successfully operating outside a circle of competence**:

1. **Learn at least the basics of the realm you’re operating in**. However, keep in mind that basic information is easy to obtain and often gives the acquirer an unwarranted confidence.

2. **Talk to someone whose circle of competence in the area is strong.** Take the time to do a bit of research to at least define questions you need to ask, and what information you need, to make a good decision.

3. Use a broad understanding of the basic mental models of the world to augment your limited understanding of the field in which you find yourself a Stranger.
