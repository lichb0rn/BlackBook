# [[How to Tolerate Pain]]

[[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] tells his students how to cope with pain and illness several times in the [[Discourses]]. Like Epicurus before him, he believed that **complaining and chattering too much about our problems just makes them worse**, and, more importantly, **it harms our character.**

Epictetus tells his students that it’s one thing to have a pain in the head or in the ear, but they should not go a step further and say, “I have a pain in the head—alas!” They shouldn’t imply that the pain is some kind of catastrophe. He explained that he wasn’t denying them the right to groan, just that they shouldn’t do so inwardly by actually buying into the notion that they’ve been harmed.

He summed up his practical advice by telling his students to respond to troubling events or unpleasant sensations by literally saying ***This is nothing to me***. This perhaps overstates things. [[Stoicism|Stoics]] can still “prefer” to avoid pain and illness when possible. Once it’s already happening, though, they try to accept the fact with indifference.

[[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] mentions many Stoic strategies for bearing pain and illness by viewing them with studied indifference. Most of these strategies were influenced by the Discourses of Epictetus:

1. **Separate your mind from the sensation**, which I call “cognitive distancing,” by reminding yourself that it is not things, or sensations, that upset us but our judgments about them.
2. Remember that **the fear of pain does more harm than pain itself**, or use other forms of functional analysis to weigh up the consequences for you of fearing versus accepting pain.
3. **View bodily sensations objectively** (objective representation, or phantasia kataleptike) instead of describing them in emotive terms. (“**There’s a feeling of pressure around my forehead**” versus “It feels like I’m dying—an elephant might as well be stamping over and over on my head!”)
4. Analyze the sensations into their elements and limit them as precisely as possible to their specific site on the body, thereby using the same depreciation by analysis that we used in the previous chapter to neutralize unhealthy desires and cravings. (“**There’s a sharp throbbing sensation in my ear that comes and goes**,” not “I’m in total agony.”)
5. **View the sensation as limited in time, changeable, and transient**, or “contemplate impermanence.” (“**This sensation only peaks for a few seconds at a time and then fades away; it will probably be gone in a couple of days**.”) If you have an acute problem like toothache, you’ll have forgotten what it felt like years from now. If you have a long-term problem such as chronic sciatica, you’ll know it sometimes gets worse and so at other times it must be less severe. It makes a difference if you can focus on the notion that this shall pass.
6. Let go of your struggle against the sensation and accept it as natural and indifferent, what is called “[[Daily Stoic practices|stoic acceptance]].” That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take practical steps to deal with it, such as using medication to reduce pain, but you must learn to live with the pain without resentment or an emotional struggle.
7. Remind yourself that Nature has given you both the capacity to exercise courage and the endurance to rise above pain and that we admire these virtues in other people, which we discussed in relation to contemplating and modeling virtue.

The Stoics want us to go through a radical upheaval in our underlying values so that our supreme goal is to live with wisdom and its accompanying virtues. They want us to **treat physical pain and injuries with indifference.**

### FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
Once you’ve gained cognitive distance, you’re in a better position to consider the consequences of your value judgments (“functional analysis”). Given that suffering arises from our negative value judgments, the Stoics say that the **fear of pain does us far more harm than pain itself because it injures our very character. Pain, by contrast, is harmless if you learn to accept it with an attitude of indifference.**

  
### OBJECTIVE REPRESENTATION 
[[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] also learned to [[Marcus Aurelius and pain|describe]] external events and bodily sensations to himself as natural processes, adopting the language of objective representation. As noted earlier, we can compare this to the neutral and detached way a physician might document the symptoms of illness in a patient.


### DEPRECIATION BY ANALYSIS
When we focus our attention on the reality of the here and now it becomes easier to conquer. **By viewing things objectively, isolating the present moment and dividing it into smaller parts, we can tackle them one at a time**, using the method we’ve called depreciation by analysis.

We should ask of each present difficulty, **“What is there in this that is unbearable or beyond endurance?**”

This [[Divide and Conquer|divide-and-conquer strategy]] is still used in modern [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive-behavioral therapy]] to combat unpleasant feelings.


### CONTEMPLATING FINITUDE AND IMPERMANENCE
Having described any painful sensations or symptoms of illness to ourselves in objective language and analyzed them into their component parts, we can usually also view them as being confined to a particular location in the body. [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] consistently reminds himself **to view pain and pleasure as belonging to the parts of the body where they’re located**—in other words, to think of the smallness of the sensation in contrast with the expansiveness of his observing consciousness. He thereby taught himself to think of pain remaining “over there” at a distance.

Therapists today help their clients objectify pain in this way by attributing an arbitrary shape or color to it, such as a black circle. This technique, called “physicalizing” the feeling, can help you picture it in your mind’s eye, from a detached perspective, at a particular location in the body.

This approach is one of Marcus’s favorite strategies for encouraging an attitude of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] indifference. **Viewing things as changeable, like a flowing river, can help weaken our emotional attachment to them.** Sometimes he goes further and reminds himself of his own transience—his mortality.

### STOIC ACCEPTANCE
Epictetus also said that **we should actively accept sickness and painful feelings if they befall us** (“Stoic acceptance”).

The concept of radically accepting unpleasant feelings has likewise become central to modern cognitive-behavioral therapy ([[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]]). **Pain becomes more painful when we struggle against it**, but the burden is often lightened, paradoxically, if we can accept the sensation and relax into it or even welcome it. Struggling to suppress, control, or eliminate unpleasant feelings adds another layer to our misery and frequently backfires by making the original problem worse.
