# [[HOW TO RELINQUISH FEAR]]

[[Эпиктет|Epictetus]] taught his students to think of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy as being like the caduceus, the magic wand of Hermes: every misfortune is transformed into something good by its touch. Stoics calmly envisaged different types of misfortune on a daily basis as part of their contemplative training, learning to view them with relative indifference.

One of the most important Stoic techniques that he employed was called acting “with a reserve clause” (hupexhairesis), a technical term that he mentions at least five times in The Meditations. In essence, it means **undertaking any action while calmly accepting that the outcome isn’t entirely under your contro**l. 

We learn from [[Seneca]] and others that it could take the form of a caveat, such as “Fate permitting,” “God willing,” or “If nothing prevents me.” It implies that one is taking action while excluding something: assumptions regarding the eventual outcome, particularly any expectations of success. We say “reserve clause,” incidentally, because our expectations are reserved for what is within our sphere of control. We’re pursuing an external result “with the reservation” that the outcome is not entirely up to us. “Do what you must, let happen what may,” as the saying goes.

Although the outcome is ultimately indifferent to Stoics, it’s precisely the action of pursuing the common good that constitutes the virtue of justice. Indeed, whether you succeed or fail in your attempts to benefit others, you may still be perfectly virtuous as long as your efforts are sincere. It’s your intentions that count, both morally and psychologically. Nevertheless, you must aim them at an appropriate outcome.

**Nothing is entirely under your control, except your own volition.** Always accepting this and preparing yourself in advance to meet both success and failure with equanimity can help you avoid feeling angry, surprised, or frustrated when events don’t turn out as you might have wished. It can also stop you from worrying about things in anticipation of them going wrong.


### THE PREMEDITATION OF ADVERSITY
If every action is to be undertaken with the reserve clause, an acceptance that we may fail, then it follows that we should anticipate a whole range of setbacks that can potentially befall us. Indeed, the Stoics broaden this strategy, p**reparing themselves to cope with adversity by patiently visualizing every major type of misfortune**, one at a time, as if it were already happening to them.

The technique of exposing yourself to stressful situations repeatedly in small doses so that you build up a more general resistance to emotional disturbance is known in behavioral psychology as “**stress inoculation”**.

[[Seneca]] calls this *praemeditatio malorum*, or the “premeditation of adversity.” The clearest example of this prospective meditation strategy in [[Meditations|The Meditations]] comes when [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]] describes part of his morning routine—preparing himself for the day ahead by anticipating various obstacles.

*“Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.”*

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] defined fear as the expectation that something bad is going to happen, which is virtually identical to the definition originally proposed by [[Aaron T. Beck]], the founder of modern [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive therapy]]. Fear is essentially a future-focused emotion, so it’s natural that we
should counter it by addressing our thoughts concerning the future. **Inoculating ourselves against stress and anxiety through the Stoic premeditation of adversity is one of the most useful techniques for building general emotional resilience**, which is what psychologists call the long-term ability to endure stressful situations without becoming overwhelmed by them.

  
### EMOTIONAL HABITUATION
Of course, we don’t always know what specific challenges we’re about to face in life. However, your general emotional resilience can be developed by training yourself in advance to cope with a broad enough range of situations.

One of the most robustly established findings in the entire field of modern psychotherapy research is the fact that anxiety tends to abate naturally during prolonged exposure to feared situations, under normal conditions. That’s been the basis of evidence-based phobia treatments since the 1950s, and it’s also an integral part of modern treatment protocols for other, more complex forms of anxiety, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).

However, in the case of imaginal exposure, maintaining the image for long enough requires considerable patience and concentration, especially when practiced as a form of self-help without the aid of a therapist. **Many people find that it helps to imagine the anxiety-provoking situation as if it were a short movie clip, or sequence of events, with a beginning, middle, and end, lasting roughly a minute or so.**

  

### THE INNER CITADEL
[[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus]]  says that at times, like many other people, he feels a strong desire to get away from things and retreat to the peace of the countryside, seashore, or mountains. However, he tells himself that **feeling the need to escape from life’s stresses in this way is a sign of weakness**. It might be what the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] called a “preferred indifferent,” but **escape is not something we should demand from life or feel we really need as a coping tool**—that sort of dependence on being able to escape from stressful situations just creates its own problems.

Marcus tells himself that he doesn’t literally need to get away from it all because **true inner peace comes from the nature of our thoughts rather than pleasant natural surroundings**. He tells himself that resilience comes from his ability to regain his composure wherever he finds himself. This is the “inner citadel” to which he can retreat, even on the frigid battlefields of the northern campaign.

In order to achieve this sense of inner peace, Marcus tells himself to frequently retreat not to the hilltops but to his own faculty of reason, thereby rising above external events and purifying his mind of attachment to them. He believes that to do this effectively he must reflect, in particular, on two concise but fundamental Stoic principles: 

1. **Everything that we see is changing and will soon be gone**, and we should bear in mind how many things have already changed over time, like the waters of streams flowing ceaselessly past—an idea that we can call the contemplation of impermanence.

2. **External things cannot touch the soul**, but our disturbances all arise from within. Marcus means that things don’t upset us, but our value judgments about them do. However, we can regain our composure by separating our values from external events using the strategy we’ve called cognitive distancing.


Another simple and powerful technique is to ask yourself **how you would feel about the situation that worries you in ten or twenty years’ time**, looking back on it from the future. It’s an example of a more general strategy known as “time projection.” In other words, you can help yourself develop a philosophical attitude toward adversity by asking, “If this will seem trivial to me twenty years from now, then why shouldn’t I view it as trivial today instead of worrying about it as if it’s a catastrophe?

  

### WORRY POSTPONEMENT
By “worry” they mean something quite specific: an anxious process exhibiting a particular style of thinking. Worried thinking is perseverative—it goes on and on. It tends to involve “What if?” thoughts about feared catastrophes: “What if they get so angry they fire me? What if I can’t get another job? How will I pay for my kids’ college?

One of the leading researchers on the psychology of worry, [[Thomas D. Borkovec]], carried out a groundbreaking study on “worry postponement.” He asked a group of college students to spot the times during a four-week period **when they began to worry about something and to respond by postponing thinking about it any further until a specified “worry time” later in the day**. Using this simple technique, the subjects were able to reduce the time spent worrying by almost half, and other symptoms of anxiety were also reduced. Worry postponement is now a central component of most [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] protocols for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a psychiatric condition characterized by severe, pathological worrying.

  
The steps to follow in worry postponement build upon the general framework that should be familiar to you by now:

1. Self-monitoring: Be constantly on the lookout for early warning signs of worry.

2. If you are unable to address your anxiety immediately using Stoic techniques, postpone thinking about it until your feelings have abated naturally, returning to the problem at a specified “worry time” of your choosing.

3. Let go of the thoughts without trying to actively suppress them—instead, just tell yourself you’re setting them aside temporarily to come back to them later at a specified time and place.

4. Return your attention to the here and now, expanding your awareness through your body and your surroundings, and try to notice small details you’d overlooked before.

5. Later, when you return to the worry, if it no longer seems important, you might just leave it alone. Otherwise, visualize the worst-case scenario or feared outcome that’s making you anxious, using the technique of imaginal exposure or premeditation of adversity.

6. Use cognitive distancing by telling yourself “It’s not things that upset me but my judgments about them.” You can also decatastrophize by describing the feared event in objective terms, without emotive language or value judgments. Remind yourself of its temporary nature by asking “What next?” and considering how things will move on over time.
