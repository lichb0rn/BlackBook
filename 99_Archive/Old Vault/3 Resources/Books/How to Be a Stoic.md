# [[How to Be a Stoic]]

## 📝 Notes
- One of Epictetus’s crucial points is that we have a strange tendency to worry about, and concentrate our energies on, precisely those things we cannot control. On the contrary, the Stoics say, we should pay attention to the parameters in life’s equation that we do control or influenceю

- One of my favorite quotations, again from Epictetus, exemplifies this down-to-earth practicality: 
>[!quote] [[Эпиктет|Epictetus]]
>Death is necessary and cannot be avoided. I mean, where am I going to go to get away from it?”
