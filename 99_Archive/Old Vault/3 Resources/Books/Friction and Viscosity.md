# [[Friction and Viscosity]]

Friction is a force that must be overcome to achieve an outcome. There is always something trying to slow us down.

While we can never eliminate the forces that impede our progress, we can work to minimize them.  

All objects experience friction. There are two key types of friction: **kinetic and static.**

**Kinetic friction occurs when two objects are sliding past each other.** This explains why an object in motion, without consistent forces pushing it forward, will come to a halt.
**Static friction, on the other hand, occurs when an object is stationary**; it’s what prevents it from moving.

 
Viscosity, which can be seen as the partner of friction, is the “**measure of how hard it is for one layer of fluid to slide over another layer.**” If a liquid is hard to move it is more viscous. If it is more viscous there is more resistance.

There are two important aspects to using friction and viscosity as a model. First, **what is easy in one environment might be harder in another**. For instance, what we can accomplish in times of peace is different than what we can accomplish in times of war. Second, we also learn that **the main forces relevant to a particular situation depend on the scale you are operating at**.
