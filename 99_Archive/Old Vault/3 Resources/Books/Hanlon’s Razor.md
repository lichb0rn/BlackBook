# [[Hanlon’s Razor]]

Hard to trace in its origin, Hanlon’s Razor states that **we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity**.

In a complex world, using this model helps us avoid paranoia and ideology. By not generally assuming that bad results are the fault of a bad actor, we look for options instead of missing opportunities. This model reminds us that people do make mistakes.

The famous [[Linda problem]], demonstrated by the psychologists [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] in a 1982 paper, is an illuminating example of how our minds work and why we need Hanlon’s Razor. It went like this:

«*Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.*»

  
Which is more probable?
1. Linda is a bank teller.
2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

The majority of respondents chose option 2. Why? The wording used to describe her suggests Linda is feminist. But Linda could only be a bank teller, or a feminist and a bank teller. So naturally the majority of students concluded she was both.

Because they were led to believe she had to be a feminist they couldn’t reject that option, even though the math of statistics makes it more likely that a single condition is true instead of multiple conditions.

Thus, Kahneman and Tversky showed that students would, with enough vivid wording, assume it more likely that a liberal-leaning woman was both a feminist and a bank teller rather than simply a bank teller. They called it the "Fallacy of Conjunction''.

**With such vividness, and the associated emotional response, comes a sort of malfunctioning in our minds** when we’re trying to diagnose the causes of a bad situation. That’s why we need Hanlon’s Razor as an important remedy. **Failing to prioritize stupidity over malice causes things like paranoia**. Always assuming malice puts you at the center of everyone else’s world. This is an incredibly self-centered approach to life. In reality, for every act of malice, there is almost certainly far more ignorance, stupidity, and laziness.
