# [[Stoicism and emotions]]

Three types of emotion: good, bad, and indifferent. They had names for many different types of good passion (*eupatheiai*), a term encompassing both desires and emotions, which they grouped under three broad headings:

1. A profound sense of joy or gladness and peace of mind, which comes from living with wisdom and virtue
2. A healthy feeling of aversion to vice, like a sense of conscience, honor, dignity, or integrity
3. The desire to help both ourselves and others, through friendship, kindness, and goodwill

They also believed that we have many irrational desires and emotions, like fear, [[Stoicism and anger management||anger]], craving, and certain forms of pleasure that are bad for us. **Stoics did not believe that unhealthy emotions should be suppressed; rather, they should be replaced by healthy ones**.

They also taught that **our initial automatic feelings are to be viewed as natural and indifferent**. These include things like being startled or irritated, blushing, turning pale, tensing up, shaking, sweating, or stammering. They are natural reflex reactions, our first reactions before we escalate them into full-blown passions. We share **these primitive precursors to emotion with some non-human animals, and so the Stoics view them with indifference, as neither good nor bad.** Indeed, [[Seneca]], as we’ll see, noted the paradox that before we can exhibit the virtues of courage and moderation, we need to have at least some trace of fear and desire to overcome.

Even the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] wise man, therefore, may tremble in the face of danger. **What matters is what he does next**. He exhibits courage and self-control precisely by accepting these feelings, rising above them, and asserting his capacity for reason. He’s not entranced by the siren song of pleasure or afraid of the sting of pain. Some pains have the potential to make us stronger, and some pleasures to harm us. What matters is the use we make of these experiences, and for that we need wisdom. The wise man will endure pain and discomfort, such as undergoing surgery or engaging in strenuous physical exercise, if it’s healthy for his body and, more important, if it’s healthy for his character.

When people talk about being stoic or having a stiff upper lip, they often mean just suppressing their feelings, which is actually known to be quite unhealthy. So it’s important to be very clear that’s not what [[Marcus Aurelius]] and other Stoics recommended. **Stoic philosophy teaches us instead to transform unhealthy emotions into healthy ones.** We do so by using reason to challenge the value judgments and other beliefs on which they’re based, much as we do in modern rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
