Реляционные намерения - это стратегия, при которой мы заранее определяем (implementation intention) наше следующее действие и его контекст. В этом случае поведение "автоматически" подстраивается под это намерение, вместо того, чтобы черпать из силы воли.

Goals (desired outcomes) are a vital part of life, and [[Getting Things Done|GTD]] can serve to facilitate both personal and professional goals. [[Gollwitzer]] and [[Oettingen]] have conducted a major line of research on goal achievement, incorporating the idea of “**implementation intentions**.”

In a nutshell they argue that the best way to **ensure goal striving** (taking actions toward a stated goal) is to create a cause-and-effect link in your mind about when certain goal-relevant actions will be taken. **When you **make plans** (implementation intentions) **ahead of time** and **decide** what **actions** will be carried out in which **contexts**, the proper **behavior** is nearly **automatically enacted** instead of being drawn from your limited reserve of [[Motivation|willpower]]**. 

In other words, if you can trust that something you will more or less do automatically will provide sufficient direction and juice to move you toward your outcome, you’ll have that juice when needed. It won’t be depleted by your constant worrying or thinking about what you should do and when.
