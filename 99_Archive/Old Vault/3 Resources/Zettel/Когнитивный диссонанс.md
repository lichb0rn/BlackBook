# [[Когнитивный диссонанс]]

Modern psychologists have discovered a pertinent phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance, a condition first described by the psychologist [[Leon Festinger]]. 

Cognitive dissonance is a very uncomfortable **psychological state that occurs when someone becomes aware of the conflict between two judgments that he holds to be equally true**. People do not want to experience cognitive dissonance, just as [[Epictetus]] said that **people do not want to knowingly be in error**. Thus, t**hey reduce dissonance by endorsing any explanation that deploys what they think are good reasons** leading to sound judgments, even though to others those reasons and judgments appear to be obvious and even absurd rationalizations. [[Aesop]] described this delightfully in his famous fable about the fox and the grapes, back in the sixth century BCE.

As the writer [[Michael Shermer]] has observed, **the more clever people are, the better they are at rationalizing away the sources of their cognitive dissonance**. Conspiracy theorists, for instance, are often brilliant at explaining what others perceive as gaping holes in their theories of how the world really works.

What’s to be done then? Once more, psychological research may be helpful here. We know that **the best way to help students change their conceptual outlook about scientific notions is to purposefully increase their cognitive dissonance until they feel so uncomfortable that they themselves seek out more information and new sources to resolve the conflict**.
