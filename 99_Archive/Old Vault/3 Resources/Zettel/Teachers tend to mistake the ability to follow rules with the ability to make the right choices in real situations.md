# [[Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations]]

In an experiment, beginner and expert paramedics and their teachers were shown scenes of CPR performed by either experienced paramedics or those who had just finished their training

As you might expect, the experienced paramedics were able to spot their kind correctly in almost all cases (~90%), while the beginners were more or less just guessing (~50%). So far, so good. But **when the teachers watched the videos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the experts for beginners.** They were wrong in most of the cases (and only right in about a third of all the cases). 

Hubert and [[Stuart Dreyfus]], researchers on expertise, have a simple explanation: **Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations.** Unlike the expert paramedics, **they did not look at the unique circumstances** and check if the paramedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individual situation. Instead, **they focused on the question of whether the people in the videos acted according to the rules they taught**. 

Because trainees lack the experience to judge a situation correctly and confidently, they need to stick to the rules they were taught, much to the delight of their teachers.

The correct application of teachable rules enables you to become a competent “performer” (which corresponds to a “3” on their five-grade expert scale), but it won’t make you a “master” (level 4) and certainly won’t turn you into an “expert” (level 5).  

**Experts**, on the other hand, have internalized the necessary knowledge so they don’t have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices. They **have acquired enough experience in various situations to be able to rely on their intuition to know what to do in which kind of situation.** 
Their decisions in complex situations are explicitly not made by long rational-analytical considerations, but rather come from the gut (cf. Gigerenzer, 2008a, 2008b). 

Here, **gut feeling** is not a mysterious force, but **an incorporated history of experience.** It is the **sedimentation of deeply learned practice through numerous feedback loops on success or failure.**
