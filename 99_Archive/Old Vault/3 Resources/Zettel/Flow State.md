# [[Flow State]]
It is not only **impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time**, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.

Usually, when we think about attention, we only think about focused attention –
something that requires [[Motivation|willpower]] to sustain.

Today, research differentiates between multiple forms of attention. Ever since [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] in the 1970s described “**flow**,” the state in which being highly focused becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975), other forms of attention, which are much
less dependent on will and effort, attracted researchers’ interest.

The **maximum duration of focused attention seems not to have changed over time** (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 91). Focused attention is different from “sustained attention,” which we need to stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn, understand or get something done. The **average duration** seems to have shrunken quite considerably over time – we practice much less focused attention than we used to. 

**We can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking.**

Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focussed attention, while
other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusively associated with creative work like art. We know today that we need both kinds of attention for art and science.

[[Oshin Vartanian]] compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus
that distinguishes them. “Specifically, ***the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.***”

The mental flexibility to be extremely focused for one moment and playfully explore ideas in the next is just one side of the equation. To be flexible, **we need an equally flexible work
structure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan**.

And it does not help us to have great insight into the necessity of being flexible in our work if we are stuck in a rigid organization. 

Unfortunately, **the most common way people organize** their writing **is by making plans**. Although planning is almost universally recommended by study guides, **it’s the equivalent
of putting oneself on rails**.
