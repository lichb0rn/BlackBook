# [[Brain Food on Willpower]]

Eventually, everyone loses the battle with willpower; it’s only a matter of time.

What looks like discipline is often a carefully created environment to encourage certain behaviors. What looks like poor choices is often someone trying their best to use willpower to go against their environment.

The people with the best defaults are typically the ones with the best environment. Sometimes it's carefully chosen, and sometimes it's just plain luck. Either way, it’s easier to align yourself with the right behavior in the right environment.

**The way to improve your defaults isn’t by willpower but by creating an artificial environment where your desired behavior becomes the default behavior.**

Joining groups whose defaults are your desires is an effective way to create an artificial environment.

Your environment will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you if you align it with where you want to go.
