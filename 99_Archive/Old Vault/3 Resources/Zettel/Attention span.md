# [[Attention span]]

We know for example that **watching television reduces the attention span** of children (Swing et al. 2010). We also know that the **average length of TV soundbites has steadily declined** over the last several decades (Fehrmann, 2011). 

During the U.S. presidential election in 1968, the average soundbite — that is, any footage of a candidate speaking uninterrupted — was still a little more than 40 seconds, but that had fallen to less than 10 seconds at the end of the 80s (Hallin 1994) and 7.8 seconds in 2000 (Lichter, 2001). 

The last election has certainly not reversed the trend. Whether that means that the media adjust to our decreasing attention span or is causing the trend is not easy to say.
