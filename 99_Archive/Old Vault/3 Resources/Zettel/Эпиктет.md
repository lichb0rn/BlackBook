# [[Эпиктет|Эпиктет]]

## ℹ️ About

Epictetus was born in Hierapolis (present-day Pamukkale in Turkey) around the year 55 CE. **Epictetus** was not his real name, which is lost to us: **the word simply means “acquired”**, reflecting the fact that he was a slave. His known master was [[Epaphroditos]], a wealthy freedman (that is, a former slave himself) who worked as a secretary to the emperor [[Nero]] in Rome, which is where Epictetus spent his youth. He was crippled, either by birth or because of an injury received while he was a slave under a former master. At any rate, Epaphroditos treated Epictetus well and allowed him to study Stoic [[Stoicism|philosophy]] under one of the most renowned teachers in Rome, [[Musonius Rufus]].

After Nero’s death in 68 CE, Epictetus was freed by his master—a common practice in Rome with particularly intelligent and educated slaves. He then **set up his own school** in the capital of the empire, and taught there until 93 CE, when the **emperor [[Domitian]] banned all philosophers** from the city. (Philosophers in general, and **Stoics in particular, were persecuted by a number of emperors**, especially [[Vespasian]] and Domitian. Scores of philosophers were either killed—including [[Seneca]] right before the end[…]

Epictetus then moved his school to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece, where he may have been visited by the emperor [[Hadrian]] (one of the five so-called good emperors, the last of whom was [[Marcus Aurelius]], arguably the most famous Stoic of all time). **Epictetus became renowned as a teacher** and attracted a number of high-profile students, including [[Arrian of Nicomedia]], who **transcribed some of the master’s lectures**. **Those lectures are known today as the [[Discourses ]]**, and I will use them as the basis for our exploration of [[Stoicism]] in this book. Epictetus never married, though late in his life he began to live with a woman who helped him raise the child of a friend, a boy who would have otherwise been left to die. Epictetus himself died around 135 CE.

## 📝 Notes
It’s one of the most unbelievable stories in all of history.

A kid is born into slavery and becomes the most influential philosopher, not just in their own lifetime, but of all time.

[Epictetus](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/r8uqg23egotoh22m933u6/7qh7h8h05063xmbz/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYWlseXN0b2ljLmNvbS9lcGljdGV0dXMv)’ name, in Greek, is literally “acquired one.” As a kid, Epictetus wanted only to be free. But in Rome, this was an impossibility. The law of the emperor–_Lex Aelia Sentia_–was that no slave could be free before their 30th birthday. So there, as the property of a violent and depraved master in a Roman Empire known for treating its slaves cruelly, Epictetus resolved to find another way, to find freedom _internally,_ in the mind, through philosophy. We don’t know how Epictetus first began his study of Stoicism under the great [Musonius Rufus](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/r8uqg23egotoh22m933u6/owhkhqh4d46508hv/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYWlseXN0b2ljLmNvbS9tdXNvbml1cy1ydWZ1cy8=), but we know the transformation it brought about.

From Musonius, Epictetus would learn about the ultimate power human beings hold. Whether banished or in bondage, empowered or enslaved, each of us controls a great empire between our ears. Over our attitudes. Our wants. Our desires. Our opinions about what has happened to us.

Epictetus would come to understand that freedom is not a legal status. It’s a state of mind. It’s a choice. And it’s our, “chief task in life,” Epictetus would famously say, to make that choice. Epictetus did.
