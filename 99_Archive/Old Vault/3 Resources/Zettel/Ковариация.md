# Ковариация

Ковариация (корреляционный момент, ковариационный момент) — в теории вероятностей и математической статистике мера зависимости двух случайных величин.

Из книги [[Data Science from Scratch]]:
>“When corresponding elements of x and y are either both above their means or both below their means, a positive number enters the sum.  When one is above its mean and the other below, a negative number enters the sum.  Accordingly, a “large” positive covariance means that x tends to be large when y is large and small when y is small.  A “large” negative covariance means the opposite—that x tends to be small when y is large and vice versa.  A covariance close to zero means that no such relationship exists.”


>“Nonetheless, this number can be hard to interpret, for a couple of reasons:
> - Its units are the product of the inputs’ units (e.g., friend-minutes-per-day), which can be hard to make sense of.  (What’s a “friend-minute-per-day”?)
> - 
> - If each user had twice as many friends (but the same number of minutes), the covariance would be twice as large.  But in a sense, the variables would be just as interrelated.  Said differently, it’s hard to say what counts as a “large” covariance.”
