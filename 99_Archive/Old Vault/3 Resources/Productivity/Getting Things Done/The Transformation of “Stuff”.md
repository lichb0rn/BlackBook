# [[The Transformation of “Stuff”]]

I define “stuff”:

> Anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn’t belong where it is, but for which you haven’t yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step. 

The reason most organizing systems haven’t worked for most people is that they haven’t yet transformed all the stuff they’re trying to organize. **As long as it’s still stuff, it’s not controllable.**

We need to transform all the “stuff” we’ve attracted and accumulated into a clear inventory of meaningful actions, projects, and usable information.
