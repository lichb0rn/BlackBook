# [[GTD Clarify]]

The best way to learn this model is by doing. But there are a few basic rules to follow:
- Process the top item first.
- Process one item at a time.
- Never put anything back into “in.”

## Top Item First
The verb process does not mean “spend time on.” It just means “decide what the thing is and what action is required, and then dispatch it accordingly.” You’re going to get to the bottom of the tray as soon as you can anyway, and you don’t want to avoid dealing with anything in there.

## One Item at a Time
You may find you have a tendency, while processing your in-tray, to pick something up, not know exactly what you want to do about it, and then let your eyes wander to another item farther down the stack and get engaged with it. That item may be more attractive to you because you know right away what to do with it—and you don’t feel like thinking about what’s in your hand. This is dangerous territory.

The focus on just one thing forces the requisite attention and decision making to get through all your stuff. And if you get interrupted (which is likely), you won’t have countless parts of “in” scattered around outside the tray and out of control again.

## Never Goes Back into "in"
The [[Habits Reduce Cognitive Load|cognitive load]] scientists have now proven the reality of “[[Decision Fatigue|decision fatigue]]”—that every decision you make, little or big, diminishes a limited amount of your brain power. Deciding to “not decide” about an e-mail or anything else is another one of those decisions, which drains your psychological fuel tank.

# What's the next action?
This is perhaps the most fundamental practice of this methodology. If there’s something that needs to be done about the item in “in,” then you need to decide what, exactly, that next action is. “Next action,” again, means the next physical, visible activity that would be required to move the situation toward closure.

Until you know what the next physical action is, there’s still more thinking required before anything can happen—before you’re appropriately engaged.

Once You Decide What the Action Step Is
You have three options once you decide what the next action really is:
- Do it ([[Two-minute rule|if the action takes less than two minutes]]).
- Delegate it (if you’re not the most appropriate person to do the action).
- Defer it into your organization system as an option for work to do later.
