# [[Natural Planning Model]]

Five steps to accomplish a task:
1. Defining [[purpose]] and principles
2. Outcome visioning
3. Brainstorming
4. Organizing
5. Identifying next actions

## Purpose

It never hurts to ask the why question. Almost anything you’re currently doing can be enhanced and even galvanized by more scrutiny at this top level of focus. Why are you going to your next meeting? What’s the purpose of your task? Why are you having friends over for dinner? Why are you hiring a marketing director instead of an agency? Why are you putting up with the situation in your service organization? Why do you have a budget?

**To know and to be clear about the purpose of any activity are prime directives for appropriate focus, creative development, and cooperation.**

Benefits of asking why:
- It defines success.
- It creates decision-making criteria.
- It aligns resources.
- It motivates.
- It clarifies focus.
- It expands options.

## Principles

Of equal value as prime criteria for driving and directing a project are the standards and values you hold.

Another great reason for focusing on principles is the clarity and reference point they provide for positive conduct. How do you want or need to work with others on this project to ensure its success? What behaviors are in-and out-of-bounds for your kids on the family vacation? You and others are at your best when you’re acting how?

Whereas purpose provides the juice and the direction, **principles define the parameters of action and the criteria for excellence of conduct**.

## Vision and Outcome

Vision provides the actual blueprint of the final result.

Your automatic creative mechanism is teleological. That is, it operates in terms of goals and end results. Once you give it a definite goal to achieve, you can depend upon its automatic guidance system to take you to that goal much better than “you” ever could by conscious thought. “You” supply the goal by thinking in terms of end results. Your automatic mechanism then supplies the means whereby.

**You often need to make it up in your mind before you can make it happen in your life.**

## Brainstorming

Once you know what you want to happen and why, the how mechanism is brought into play. When you identify with some picture in your mind that is different from your current reality, you automatically start filling in the gaps, or brainstorming. We need to capture them.

The most popular of these concepts and techniques is called [[mind mapping]], a name coined by [[Tony Buzan]].

Many techniques can be used to facilitate brainstorming and out-of-the-box thinking. The basic principles, however, can be summed up as follows:
- Don’t judge, challenge, evaluate, or criticize.
- Go for quantity, not quality.
- Put analysis and organization in the background.

Determining what might go most wrong in a situation is at times the best way to generate the best ideas about how to make it successful.

## Organizing

Organizing usually happens when you identify components and subcomponents, sequences of events, and/or priorities. What are **the things that must occur to create the final result**? In what order must they occur? What is the most important element to ensure the success of the project?

This is the stage in which you can make good use of **structuring tools**.

The key steps here are:
- Identify the significant pieces
- Sort by (one or more):
	- components
	- sequences
	- priorities
- Detail to the required degree

## Next actions

The final stage of planning comes down to decisions about the allocation and reallocation of physical resources to actually get the project moving. The question to ask here is, **“What’s the next action?”**

The key steps:
- Decide on next actions for each of the current “moving parts” of the project.
- Decide on the next action in the planning process, if necessary.
