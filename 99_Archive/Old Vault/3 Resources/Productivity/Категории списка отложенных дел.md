# Special Categories of [[Someday-Maybe list|Someday/Maybe]]

More than likely you have some special interests that involve lots of possible things to do. It can be fun to collect these on lists. For instance:

-   Food—recipes, menus, restaurants, wines
-   Children—things to do with them
-   Books to read
-   Music to download
-   Movies to see
-   Gift ideas
-   Web sites to explore
-   Weekend trips to take
-   Ideas—Misc. (meaning you don’t know where else to put them!)

  
In any case, this is another great reason to have an organizing system that makes it easy to capture things that may add value and variety and interest to your life—without clogging your mind and work space with undecided, unfinished business.
