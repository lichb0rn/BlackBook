# [[Getting Projects Under Control]]

If you **feel out of control** with your current actionable commitments, you’ll **resist focused planning**; an unconscious pushback occurs.

Two types of projects, however, that deserve at least some sort of planning activity: 
- those that still have your attention even after you’ve determined their next actions
- those about which potentially useful ideas and supportive detail just show up ad hoc.


## Typical Planning Steps

	 Some of the projects that have your attention right now will require you to do your own free-form thinking; this is especially true of those for which you were not clear about what the next action would be when you made that decision. These should all have a next action, such as “Draft ideas re X.
- Organizing 
	- You may have some projects for which you have already collected notes and miscellaneous support materials, and you just need to sort through them and get them into a more structured form. In this case, your next action would likely be “Organize Project X notes.
- Gathering Information 
	- Sometimes the next task on project thinking is to gather more data. 
		- “Call Bill re his thoughts on the managers’ meeting”
		- “Review Associate Conference archive files”

>If you don’t have a good system for storing bad ideas, you probably don’t have one for filing good ones, either.


## Applying

Give yourself a block of time, ideally between one and three hours, to handle as much of the vertical thinking about each project as you can. Take those few of your projects that you have the most attention on or interest in right now and do some thinking, collecting, and organizing on them.
