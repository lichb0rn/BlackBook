[[Tiago Forte]] рекомендует 2 типа чеклистов: Project Kickoff и Project Completion.

## Project Kickoff Checklist

Here’s my own checklist:

1. Capture my current thinking on the project.
2. Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.
3. Search for related terms across all folders.
4. Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder.
5. Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.

## Project Completion Checklist

We don’t want to limit ourselves to merely celebrating the end of a project. We want to **learn from the experience** and document any thinking that could add value in the future. This is where the Project Completion Checklist is essential. It’s a series of steps you can take to decide if there are any reusable knowledge assets worth keeping, before archiving the rest.

Here’s my checklist:

1. Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app.
2. Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section.
3. Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders.
4. Move project to archives across all platforms.
5. If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving.

### Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders.

Third, I’ll look through the folder for the completed project to** identify any Intermediate Packets** I created that could be repurposed in the future. This could include a web-page design to be used as a template for future sites, an agenda for a one-on-one performance review, or a series of interview questions that might come in handy for future hires. It takes a certain lens to see each of these documents and files **not as disposable**, but as **tangible byproducts** of quality thinking. Much of our work gets repeated over time with slight variations. If you can start your thinking where you left off last time, you’ll be far ahead compared to starting from zero every time.

Any IPs I decide could be relevant to another project, I move to that project’s folder. The same goes for notes relevant to areas or resources. This is a forgiving decision, and it’s okay if you don’t catch every single one. The full contents of everything you archive away will always show up in future searches, so you don’t have to worry that anything will be lost.

### If project is becoming inactive

The fifth step applies only if the project is getting canceled, postponed, or put on hold instead of completed.

I add a new note to the project folder titled “**Current status**”, and jot down a few comments so I can pick it back up in the future. For example, in a few bullet points I might describe **the last actions I took**, details on** why it was postponed or canceled**, who was working on it and what role they played, and any lessons or best practices learned. This [[The Hemingway Bridge|Hemingway bridge]] gives me the confidence to put the project on ice knowing I can bring it back to life anytime.
