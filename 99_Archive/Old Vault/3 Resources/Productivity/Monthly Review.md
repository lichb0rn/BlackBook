# Monthly Review

While the Weekly Review is grounded and practical, I recommend doing a Monthly Review that is a bit more reflective and holistic. It’s a chance to **evaluate the big picture** and consider more fundamental changes to your goals, priorities, and systems that you might not have the chance to think about in the busyness of the day-to-day.

Here’s mine:

1. Review and update my goals.
2. Review and update my project list.
3. Review my areas of responsibility.
4. Review someday/maybe tasks.
5. Reprioritize tasks.

## Review and update goals

1. Review and update my goals. I start by reviewing my goals for the quarter and the year. I ask myself questions like “**What successes or accomplishments did I have?**” and “**What went unexpectedly and what can I learn from it?**” I’ll take some time to cross off any completed goals, add any new ones that have emerged, or change the scope of goals that no longer make sense.

## Review and update project list

2. Review and update my project list. Next, I’ll review and update my project list. This includes archiving any completed or canceled projects, adding any new ones, or updating active projects to reflect how they’ve changed. It’s important that the **project list** remains a current, timely, and **accurate reflection of your real-life goal**s and priorities.

## Review AoS

3. Review my areas of responsibility. Now it’s time to do the same for my areas of responsibility. I’ll think about the major areas of my life, such as my health, finances, relationships, and home life, and decide if there’s anything I want to change or take action on. This reflection often generates new action items (which go into my task manager) and new notes (which get captured in my notes app).
