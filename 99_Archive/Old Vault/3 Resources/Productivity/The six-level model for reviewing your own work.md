# [[The six-level model for reviewing your own work]]

The six levels of work may be thought of in terms of altitude, as in the floors of a building:
- Horizon 5: Life
- Horizon 4: Long-term visions
- Horizon 3: One-to two-year goals
- Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
- Horizon 1: Current projects
- Ground: Current actions
 
 Your priorities will sit in a hierarchy from the top down.


## Working from the bottom up

The **most important thing to deal with is whatever is most on your mind**. The fact that you think it shouldn’t be on your mind is irrelevant. **It’s there, and it’s there for a reason.**

- Ground 
	- The first thing to do is make sure your action lists are complete
- Horizon 1 
	- Finalize your Projects list
		- Does it truly capture all the commitments you have that will require more than one action to get done?
		- That will define the boundaries of the kind of week-to- week operational world you’re in and allow you to relax your thinking for longer intervals.
		- When people get their Projects list up-to-date, they discover there are several things that could be done readily to move things they care about forward.

>[!note]
>Taking the inventory of your current work at all levels will automatically produce greater focus, alignment, and sense of priorities.

- Horizon 2 
	- This is the level of “current job responsibilities” and “areas of my life to maintain at an appropriate standard.
		- I recommend that you make and keep a list called **“Areas of Focus**.” You might like to separate this into “Professional” and “Personal” sublists, in which case you’ll want to use them both equally for a consistent review. This is one of the most useful checklists you can create for your own self-management.
		- Depending on the speed of change in some of the more important areas of your life and work, this **should be used as a trigger for potential new projects** every one to three months.
		- The operational purpose of the Areas of Focus list is to ensure that you have all your projects and next actions defined
- Horizons 3-5
	- It’s more about “**What is true right now about where I’ve decided I’m going and how I’m going to get there?**” 
	- This can range from one-year goals in your job (Horizon 3) to a three-year vision for your career and personal net worth (Horizon 4) to intuiting your life purpose and how to maximize its expression (Horizon 5).

If you’re involved in anything that has a future of longer than a year (marriage, kids, career, a company, an art form, a lifelong passion), you would do well to think about what you might need to be doing to manage things along that vector.

Questions to ask are:
- **What are the longer-term goals** and objectives in my organization, and **what projects do I need to have** in place related to them to fulfill my responsibilities?
- **What longer-term goals and objectives have I set for myself**, and **what projects do I need** to have in place to make them happen?
- **What other significant things are happening** that could affect my options about what I’m doing?
