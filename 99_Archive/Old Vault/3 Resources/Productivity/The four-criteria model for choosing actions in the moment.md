# [[The four-criteria model for choosing actions in the moment]]

You make your action choices based on the following four criteria, in order:
- Context
- Time available
- Energy available
- Priority


## Context

The first thing to consider is, what could you possibly do, where you are, with the tools you have. It’s often helpful to organize your action reminders by context—**Calls, At Home, At Computer, Errands, Agenda for Joe, Agenda for Staff Meeting**, and so on.


## Time Available

Basically how much time you have before you have to do something else.


## Energy available

Always keep an inventory of things that need to be done that require very little mental or creative horsepower.

This is one of the best reasons for having very clean edges to your personal management system: **it makes it easy to continue doing productive activity when you’re not in top form**. If you’re **in a low-energy mode** and your reading material is disorganized, **your receipts are all over the place**, your filing system is chaotic, and your in-tray is dysfunctional, it just seems like too much work to find and organize the tasks at hand, so you simply avoid doing anything at all and then you feel even worse.


## Priority

Given the context you’re in and the time and energy you have, the obvious next criterion for action choice is relative priority: "Out of all my remaining options, **what is the most important thing for me to do?**"
