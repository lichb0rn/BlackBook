The main emphasis of this project is to provide recommendations on how to design software applications. This readme includes techniques, tools, best practices, architectural patterns and guidelines gathered from different sources.

Code examples are written using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) framework and [Slonik](https://github.com/gajus/slonik) for the database access.

Patterns and principles presented here are **framework/language agnostic**. Therefore, the above technologies can be easily replaced with any alternative. No matter what language or framework is used, any application can benefit from principles described below.

**Note**: code examples are adapted to TypeScript and frameworks mentioned above.   
(Implementations in other languages will look differently)
