## Network address

The TCP network address that you pass to `http.ListenAndServe()` should be in the format "`host:port`". If you omit the host ("`:4000"`) then the **server will listen on all your computer’s available network interfaces**. Generally, you only need to specify a host in the address if your computer has multiple network interfaces and you want to listen on just one of them.

In other Go projects or documentation you might sometimes see network addresses written using named ports like `":http"` or `":http-alt" `instead of a number. If you use a named port then the `http.ListenAndServe()` function **will attempt to look up the relevant port number from your `/etc/services` file** when starting the server, returning an error if a match can’t be found.
