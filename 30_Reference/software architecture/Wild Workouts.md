Wild Workouts is an **example Go DDD** project that we created to show how to build Go applications that are **easy to develop, maintain, and fun to work with, especially in the long term!**

_The idea for this series, is to apply DDD by refactoring. This process is in progress! Please check articles, to know the current progress._

No application is perfect from the beginning. With over a dozen coming articles, we will uncover what issues you can find in the current implementation. We will also show how to fix these issues and achieve clean implementation by refactoring.
